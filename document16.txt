thegreatestofitssons isnotadeed tobeunder-
taken light-heartedly especially byonebelong-
ingtothatpeople. Noconsideration, however,
willmove rne tosetaside truth infavour
ofsupposednational interests. Moreover, the
elucidation ofthemere facts oftheproblem may
beexpectedtodeepen ourinsightinto the
situation withwhich theyareconcerned.
ThemanMoses, theliberator ofhispeople, who
gavethem theirreligion andtheir laws, belonged
toanagesoremote thatthepreliminary question
arises whether hewasanhistoricalpersonora
legendary figure.Ifhelived, histimewasthe
thirteenth orfourteenthcentury B.C.;wehave
noword ofhimbutfrom theHoly Books and
thewritten traditions oftheJews. Although
thedecision lacks final historicalcertainty,the
great majorityofhistorians haveexpressedthe
opinionthatMoses didliveandthattheexodus
fromEgypt,ledbyhim, didinfacttakeplace.
12 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
Ithasbeen maintained withgood reason that
thelaterhistoryofIsrael could notbeunderstood
ifthiswere notadmitted. Scienceto-day has
become much more cautious and dealsmuch
more leniently with tradition than itdidinthe
early daysofhistoricalinvestigation.
What first attracts ourinterest intheperson of
Moses ishisname, which iswritten Mosche in
Hebrew. Onemay well ask:Where does it
come from ?What does itmean ?As iswell
known, thestoryinExodus, Chapter ii,already
answers thisquestion. There welearn that the
Egyptian princess whosaved thebabefrom the
waters oftheNilegavehim hisname, addingthe
etymological explanation:because Idrewhim
out of thewater. Butthisexplanationisobviously
inadequate."The biblicalinterpretation ofthe
name'Hethatwasdrawn outofthewater5"
thusanauthor oftheJudischesLexikon1"isfolk
etymology;theactive Hebrew form itself ofthe
name (Moschecan atbestmean only'the
drawer out5
)cannot bereconciled with this
solution." Thisargument canbesupported by
twofurther reflections :first, that itisnonsensical
tocredit anEgyptian princesswithaknowledge
ofHebrew etymology, and, secondly,that the
water fromwhich thechildwasdrawn wasmost
probablynotthewater oftheNile.

Itmight have beenexpectedthatoneofthe
manyauthors who recognized Moses tobean

clusion, oratleast considered thepossibility,
thatthebearer ofanEgyptian name washimself

Themost remote ofthehistoricalpersonages

thefounder ofBabylon about 2800 B.C.From the
pointofview ofwhat interests ushere itwould
perhapsbeworth while toreproducetheaccount

"IamSargon,themighty king, King of

Thesource andthetendency ofsuchmythsare
familiar tousthrough Rank's work. Ineed only
refer tohisconclusions with afewshort hints.
Ahero isamanwho stands upmanfully against
hisfather andintheendvictoriously overcomes
him.Themythinquestiontraces thisstruggle
back totheverydawn ofthehero'slife,byhaving
himbornagainsthisfather's willandsaved in
spiteofhisfather's evilintentions. Theexposure
inthebasket isclearlyasymbolical representa-
tionofbirth;thebasket isthewomb, thestream
thewater atbirth. Ininnumerable dreams the
relation ofthechild totheparentsisrepresented
bydrawingorsaving from thewater. When the
imagination ofapeopleattaches thismythtoa
famouspersonageitistoindicate thathe is
recognizedasahero, that hislifehasconformed
tothetypical plan.Theinner source ofthemyth
istheso-called"
family romance"ofthechild,
inwhich thesonreacts tothechangeinhisinner
relationshiptohisparents, especiallythat tohis
father. The child's firstyearsaregoverned by
grandiose over-estimation ofhisfather; kings
andqueensindreams andfairytales always
represent, accordingly, theparents.Later on,
under theinfluence ofrivalry andrealdisappoint-
ments, therelease from theparents andacritical
attitude towards thefather sets in.Thetwo
families ofthemyth,thenoble aswell asthe
humble one,aretherefore bothimagesofhisown

Itisnottoomuch tosaythatthese observations

spreadoccurrence ofthemythofthebirth ofthe

themyth ofMoses5birth andexposurestands

Westartwith thetwofamilies between which
themyth hascastthechild's fate.Weknow that
analytic interpretation makes them intoone
family,that thedistinction isonly atemporal
one. Inthetypical form ofthemyththe first
family,intowhich thechild isborn,isanobleand
mostlyaroyal one; thesecondfamily,inwhich
thechild grows up,isahumble anddegraded
one, corresponding with thecircumstances to
which theinterpretationrefers. Onlyinthe
story of(Edipusisthisdifference obscured. The
babe exposed byonekingly familyisbrought up
byanotherroyal pair.Itcanhardly bean
accident that inthisoneexamplethere isinthe
mythitself aglimmer oftheoriginal identity of
thetwo families. The social contrast ofthetwo
families meant,asweknow, tostress the heroic

elevate him toahighersocial rank. Thus Cyrus
isfortheMedes analienconqueror; bywayof
theexposure myth hebecomes thegrandson of
theirking.Asimilar traitoccurs inthemyth of
Romulus :ifsuchaman everlivedhemusthave
beenanunknown adventurer, anupstart;the
myth makes himadescendant of,and heirto,
theroyal house ofAlba Longa.
Itisverydifferent inthecaseofMoses. Here
the firstfamily usuallysodistinguishedis
modest enough. ^He isthe child ofJewish
Leyites. Butthesecondfamilythehumble one
inwhich asarule heroes arebrought upis
replaced bytheRoyal house ofEgypt;the
princess brings himupasherown son. This
divergence from theusualtypehasstruck many
research workers asstrange.E.Meyer andothers
afterhimsupposedtheoriginal form ofthemyth
tohavebeen different. Pharaoh hadbeenwarned
byaprophetic dream1that hisdaughter's son
would become adangertohimand hiskingdom.
This iswhyhehasthechild delivered tothe
waters oftheNileshortlyafter his birth. Butthe
child issaved byJewish people andbrought up
astheir own."National motives"inRank's
terminology2hadtransformed themythintothe
formnowknown byus.
However, further thoughttells usthatan

original Moses mythofthiskind, onenotdiverg-
ingfrom other birth myths, could nothave
existed. Forthelegendiseither ofEgyptian or
ofJewish origin. The firstsupposition maybe
excluded. The Egyptians hadnomotive to
glorify Moses; tothem hewasnotahero. So
thelegendshould haveoriginated amongthe
Jewish people;that istosay,itwasattached in
theusual version tothepersonoftheir leader.
But forthatpurposeitwasentirely unfitted;
what goodisalegendtoapeoplethatmakes
their hero intoanalien ?
TheMoses mythasweknow itto-day lags
sadly behind itssecret motives. IfMoses isnot
ofroyal lineage ourlegend cannot makehiminto
ahero;ifheremains aJewithasdonenothing
toraise hisstatus. Only onesmall feature ofthe
whole myth remains effective :theassurance that
thebabe survived inspiteofstrongoutside forces
tothecontrary. This feature isrepeatedinthe
early history ofJesus, where KingHerod assumes
theroleofPharaoh. Sowereally have aright
toassume that inalaterand rather clumsy
treatment ofthelegendary material theadapter
saw fittoequiphisheroMoses with certain
featuresappertainingtothe classicalexposure
mythscharacteristic ofahero,andyetunsuited
toMoses byreason ofthespecialcircumstances.
With thisunsatisfactory andeven uncertain
result ourinvestigation would have toend,
22 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
without having contributed anythingtoanswering
the"question whether Moses wasEgyptian, were
there notanother andperhaps more successful
wayofapproachingtheexposure mythitself.
Letusreturn tothetwofamilies inthemyth.
Asweknow, onthelevel ofanalytic interpreta-
tiontheyareidentical. Onamythicallevel they
aredistinguishedasthenoble andthehumble
family. With anhistoricalpersontowhom the
mythhasbecome attached thereis,however, a
third level, thatofreality. Oneofthefamilies is
therealone, theoneintowhich thegreatman
wasreally bornandinwhich hewasbrought up.
Theother isfictitious, invented bythemythin
pursuanceofitsown motives. Asarulethereal
family correspondswith thehumble one, the
noble family with thefictitious one. Inthecase
ofMoses something seemed tobedifferent. And
here thenewpointofviewmayperhaps bring
some illumination. Itisthat the firstfamily,
theonefromwhich thebabe isexposedtodanger,
isinallcomparablecases thefictitious one; the
secondfamily, however, bywhich thehero is
adopted andinwhich hegrows upishisrealone.
Ifwehave thecouragetoacceptthisstatement
asageneraltruth towhich theMoseslegendalso
issubject, thenwesuddenlyseeourwayclear.
Moses isanEgyptian probablyofnobleorigin

exposureinthewater wasinitsright place;to
fitthenew conclusion theintention had tobe
changed, notwithout violence. From ameans of
gettingridofthechild itbecomes ameans ofits

ThedivergenceoftheMoseslegend from all
others ofitskind might betraced back toa

inallother cases thehero risesabove hishumble
beginningsashis lifeprogresses,theheroic life
ofthemanMoses began bydescending from
hiseminence tothe level ofthechildren of
Israel.
This littleinvestigation wasundertaken inthe
hopeofgaining from itasecond, freshargument
forthesuggestionthatMoses wasanEgyptian.
Wehave seen thatthe firstargument,thatofhis
name, hasnotbeen considered decisive.1We
have tobepreparedforthenewreasoningthe
analysisoftheexposure myth notfaring any
better. Theobjectionislikelytobethat the
circumstances oftheorigin andtransformation of

clusion asthepreceding one,andthat allefforts

origin, but itproves thattheyhadrelations withEgypt." (p.651 .)

thisnegative attitude, but Iamnotinaposition
toconfute it.
Iftherewasnomorecertainty than thistobe

justificationhas torestrict itself tohints.If,
however, one isattracted bythetwoarguments
outlined above, and tries totakeseriously the

toanswer. When apeopleofatribe1prepares

thehead of athrong ofculturallyinferior immi-
grants, and toleave thecountry with them,is
noteasytoconjecture. Thewell-known contempt
oftheEgyptiansforforeigners makes such a
proceeding especially unlikely. Indeed, Iam
inclined tothink this iswhyeven those historians
who recognizedthename asEgyptian, and
ascribed allthewisdom ofEgypttohim,werenot
willingtoentertain theobviouspossibilitythat
Moses wasanEgyptian.
This firstdifficultyisfollowed byasecond. We
must notforgetthatMoses wasnotonlythe
politicalleader oftheJewssettled inEgypt,he
was also their law-giver andeducator andthe
manwho forced them toadoptanewreligion,
which isstillto-daycalled Mosaic after him.
Butcanasingle personcreate anewreligionso
easily?Andwhen someone wishes toinfluence
thereligionofanother would notthemost
natural thing betoconvert him tohisown ?
The Jewish peopleinEgyptwerecertainly
notwithout some kind ofreligion, and if
Moses, whogavethem anewreligion, wasan
Egyptian,then thesurmise cannot berejected
that thisothernewreligion was theEgyptian
one.
Thispossibilityencounters anobstacle: the
sharpcontrast between theJewish religion
attributed toMoses and theEgyptianone.
Theformer isagrandiosely rigid monotheism.
32 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
There isonly oneGod, unique, omnipotent,
unapproachable. Thesightofhiscountenance
cannot beborne; onemust notmake animage
ofhim, noteven breathe hisname. Inthe
Egyptian religion, ontheother hand, there is
abewildering mass ofdeities ofdiffering impor-
tance andprovenance. Some ofthem areper-
sonifications ofgreatnatural powerslikeheaven
and earth, sunandmoon. Thenwefindan
abstraction such asMaat(Justice, Truth)ora
grotesquecreature likethedwarfish Bes.Most
ofthem, however, arelocal godsfrom thetime
when theland was divided intonumerous
provinces. They have theshapesofanimals as
iftheyhadnotyetovercome theirorigin from
theoldtotem animals. Theyarenotclearly
differentiated, barely distinguished byspecial
functions attributed tosome ofthem. Thehymns
inpraiseofthese godstellthesame thing about
each ofthem, identify them withoneanother
without any misgivingsinawaythatwould
confuse ushopelessly. Names ofdeities are
combined withoneanother, sothatonebecomes
degraded almost toanepithetoftheother. Thus
inthebestperiod ofthe"NewEmpire"the
maingodofthecityofThebes iscalledAmon-Re
inwhich combination the firstpart signifiesthe
ram-headedcity-god, whereas Re isthename of
thehawk-headed Sun-God ofOn.Magic and
ceremonial, amulets and formulas, dominated
IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN33
theservice ofthesegods,asthey didthedaily
lifeoftheEgyptians.
Some ofthese differences may easily derive
from thecontrast inprinciple between astrict
monotheism andanunlimitedpolytheism. Others
areobviously consequencesofadifference in
intellectual level; onereligionisverynear tothe
primitive,theother hassoared totheheights of
sublime abstraction. Perhapsitisthese two
characteristics that occasionally giveone the
impressionthatthecontrast between theMosaic
andtheEgyptian religionisoneintended and
purposelyaccentuated: forexample, when the
onereligion severely condemns anykind of
magicorsorcery which flourishes soabundantly
intheother;orwhen theinsatiable zestofthe
Egyptianformaking images ofhisgodsinclay,
stoneandmetal, towhich ourmuseums owe so
much,iscontrasted with thewayinwhich the
making oftheimage ofany living orvisionary
beingisbluntly forbidden.
There isyetanother difference between the
two religions, which theexplanations wehave
attempted donottouch. Nootherpeople of
antiquityhasdone somuch todeny death, has
made such carefulprovisionforanafter-life; in
accordance with thisthedeath-god Osiris, the
ruler ofthatother world, wasthemosj; popular
andindisputableofallEgyptian gods.^The early
Jewish religion, ontheother hand, hadentirely
34MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
relinquished immortality;thepossibilityofan
existence afterdeath wasnever mentioned inany
place. And this isallthemore remarkable since
later experiencehasshown that thebelief ina
lifebeyond canverywellbereconciled with a
monotheisticreligion.
WehadhopedthesuggestionthatMoses was
anEgyptian would prove enlightening and
stimulatinginmanydifferentrespects. Butour
firstdeduction from thissuggestionthatthenew
religionhegavetheJews was hisown, the
Egyptianone hasfoundered onthedifference,
naythestriking contrast, between thetwo
religions.

Astrangefact inthehistory oftheEgyptian
religion, which wasrecognized andappraised
relatively late,opens upanotherpointofview.
Itisstillpossiblethatthereligion Moses gaveto
hisJewish peoplewasyethisown, anEgyptian
religion thoughnot theEgyptianone.
Intheglorious Eighteenth Dynasty, when
Egypt became forthe firsttime aworldpower,
ayoung Pharaoh ascended thethrone about
1375B.C.,who firstcalled himself Amenhotep (IV)
like hisfather, but lateronchangedhisname
andnotonlyhisname. Thiskingundertook

the firstattemptofitskind inthehistoryofthe
world asfarasweknow andreligiousintoler-
ance, which wasforeigntoantiquitybefore this
and forlong after, wasinevitably born with the
belief inoneGod. ButAmenhotep's reignlasted
onlyforseventeenyears; very soon after his
death in1358thenewreligion wasswept away
andthememoryofthehereticking proscribed.
From theruins ofhisnewcapital which hehad
builtanddedicated tohisGod, andfrom the

derive the little knowledge wepossess ofhim.
Everything wecanlearn about thisremarkable,

Everything newmusthave itsroots inwhatwas

Political conditions inEgypt hadabout that

Egyptian religion. Through thevictorious sword
ofthegreat conqueror Thothmes IIIEgypt had
become aworld power. Nubia inthesouth,
Palestine, Syria andapartofMesopotamiain
thenorth hadbeenadded totheEmpire. This
imperialism wasreflected inreligionasUniversal-

nowextended beyond EgypttoNubia andSyria,
Deityitselfhad togiveupitsnational limitation
andthenewGodoftheEgyptians hadtobecome
likePharaoh theunique andunlimitedsovereign
oftheworld known totheEgyptians. Besides,
itwas natural that asthe frontiers extended
Egyptshould become accessible toforeign

princesses,1andpossibly even directencourage-

Weventure now todraw thefollowing con-

completely ignored. He isnever mentioned inanyrecord of

42MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
There would beashortwayofproving our
thesis that theMosaicreligionisnothingelse
butthatofAton, namely, byaconfession of
faith, aproclamation.But Iamafraid Ishould
betoldthatsuch aroad isimpracticable. The
Jewish creed, asiswellknown, says:"Schema
Jisroel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echod." Ifthe
similarityofthename oftheEgyptian Aton(or

Syriandivinename Adonis isnotamere accident,
but istheresult ofaprimaeval unityinlanguage
andmeaning,then onecould translate the
Jewishformula: Hear, ohIsrael, ourgodAton

unqualifiedtoanswer thisquestion andhave
been able tofindverylittle about itinthe
literature concerned,1butprobably wehad
better notmakethingssosimple. Moreover, we
shallhave tocome back totheproblems ofthe

Thepointsofsimilarityaswell asthose of

Egyptian,forexample, when itforbids allvisual

difference apartfrom thename oftheirGod
isthat theJewish religion entirely relinquishes
theworshipofthesun, towhich theEgyptian one
stilladhered. When comparingtheJewish with
theEgyptianfolkreligion wereceived the
impression that, besides thecontrast inprinciple,
there was inthedifference between thetwo
religionsanelement ofpurposivecontradiction.
Thisimpression appears justified when inour
comparison wereplacetheJewish religion bythat
ofAton, which Ikhnaton asweknowdeveloped
indeliberate antagonismtothepopular religion.

contradicts it.Ontheonehand,itdates the

from thewrath ofGodbyspeedily performing
theoperation. These aredistortions, however,
which should notleadusastray; weshallexplore
their motivespresently. The factremains that
thequestion concerningtheorigin ofcircumcision
hasonly oneanswer: itcomes fromEgypt.
Herodotus,"theFather ofHistory,55tellsusthat
thecustom ofcircumcision had long been
practisedinEgypt, and hisstatement hasbeen
confirmed bytheexamination ofmummies and
evenbydrawings onthewalls ofgraves. No
otherpeopleoftheEastern Mediterranean has
asfarasweknow followed thiscustom; wecan
assume withcertaintythat theSemites, Baby-

fromandthesuggestion weadded toitareso
incompatiblewitheach other thatweventure to
draw thefollowing conclusion: IfMoses gave
theJews notonlyanewreligion, butalsothe
lawofcircumcision, hewasnoJew butan
Egyptian, and then theMosaicreligion was
probably anEgyptian one,namely because of
itscontrast tothepopular religionthatofAton
withwhich theJewish oneshows agreementin
some remarkablepoints.
AsIremarked earlier, myhypothesisthat
Moses wasnotaJewbutanEgyptiancreates a
newenigma. What hedideasily understand-
able ifhewere aJew becomesunintelligiblein
anEgyptian.But ifweplaceMoses inIkhnaton's
period and associate himwith thatPharaoh,
then theenigmaisresolved andapossible motive
presents itself, answeringallourquestions. Let
usassume thatMoses wasanoble and distin-
guished man: perhaps indeed amember ofthe
royal house, asthemythhas it.Hemusthave
been conscious ofhisgreat abilities, ambitious
andenergetic; perhaps hesawhimself inadim
future asthe leader ofhispeople,thegovernor
oftheEmpire.Inclose contact withPharaoh he
wasaconvinced adherent ofthenewreligion,
whose basicprinciples hefully understood and
hadmade hisown. With theking's death and
thesubsequentreaction hesaw allhishopes and
prospects destroyed.Ifhewasnottorecant the
IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN47
convictions sodear tohimthenEgypt hadno
more togivehim; hehad losthisnativecountry.
Inthishourofneedhefound anunusual solution.
Thedreamer Ikhnaton hadestrangedhimself
from hispeople, had lethisworld empirecrumble.
Moses5active nature conceived theplanoffound-
inganewempire, offindinganewpeople,to
whom hecouldgivethereligionthatEgypt
disdained. Itwas, asweperceive, anheroic
attempttostruggle againsthisfate, tofindcom-
pensationintwodirections forthelosses hehad
suffered throughIkhnaton'scatastrophe. Perhaps
hewas atthetime governorofthat border
province (Gosen)inwhichperhaps alreadyin
"theHyksos period"certain Semitic tribeshad
settled. These hechose tobehisnewpeople.
Anhistoric decision.1
Heestablished relations with them, placed
himself attheir headand directed theExodus
"bystrength ofhand." Infullcontradistinction
totheBiblical tradition wemay supposethis
Exodus tohavepassedoffpeacefully andwithout
pursuit. TheauthorityofMosesmade itpossible,

andtherewasthennocentral powerthatcould
have preventedit.
Accordingtoourconstruction theExodus from
Egypt would have takenplace between 1358and
1350,that istosay,after thedeath ofIkhnaton
andbeforetherestitution oftheauthority ofthe
statebyHaremhab.1Thegoalofthewandering
could onlybeCanaan. After thesupremacy of
Egypt hadcollapsed,hordes ofwar-likeArameans
hadflooded thecountry, conquering andpillag-

Hebrews, whocame laterandcould nothave

tribeswhowere themostnearlyrelated tothe
Jewsnow leaving Egyptalso lived south of
Palestine inCanaan.
Themotivation thatwehave surmised forthe
Exodus asawhole covers alsotheinstitution of
circumcision. Weknow inwhatmanner human
beings bothpeoples and individuals react to
thisancient custom, scarcely anylonger under-

whohaveadoptedcircumcision areproud ofthe
custom. Theyfeelsuperior, ennobled, andlook
down withcontemptattheothers, whoappear
tothem unclean. Even to-day theTurk hurls
abuse attheChristian bycalling him"anun-
circumcised dog.55Itiscredible thatMoses, who
asanEgyptian washimself circumcised, shared
this attitude. TheJews withwhom helefthis

account ofhistravels acharacteristic oftheEgyptians which
shows anastounding similarity withwell-known features ofthe
laterJewish people."They areinallrespects much more pious

Some ofmyown critical observations may
continue thediscussion. Thekernel ofourthesis,
thedependenceofJewish monotheism onthe
monotheisticepisodeinEgyptian history, has
been guessed andhinted atbyseveral workers.
Ineed notcitethem here, sincenone ofthem has
been able tosaybywhatmeans thisinfluence
wasexerted. Evenif,asIsuggest,itisbound up
with theindividualityofMoses, weshall have
toweighotherpossibilitiesthan theonehere
preferred.Itisnottobesupposedthattheover-
throw ofthe official Atonreligion completely
putanend tothemonotheistic trend inEgypt.
The School ofPriests atOn,from which it
emanated, survived thecatastrophe andmight
havedrawn wholegenerationsafter Ikhnaton
into theorbit oftheirreligious thought. That
Mosesperformedthedeed isquite thinkable,
therefore, even ifhedidnot liveinIkhnaton's
timeandhad notcome under hispersonal
influence, even ifhewere simply anadherent or
merelyamember oftheschool ofOn. This
52 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
conjecture would postponethedate ofthe
Exodus andbringitnearer tothetimeusually
assumed, thethirteenth century; otherwise it
hasnothingtorecommend it.Weshould have
torelinquishtheinsight wehadgainedinto
Moses5motives and todispense with theideaof
theExodusbeingfacilitated bytheanarchy
prevailinginEgypt. ThekingsoftheNineteenth
Dynasty following Ikhnaton ruled thecountry
withastrong hand. Allconditions, internal and
external, favouringtheExodus coincide onlyin
theperiod immediatelyafter thedeath ofthe
hereticking.
TheJews possessarichextra -biblical literature
where themyths andsuperstitionsaretobefound
which inthecourse ofcenturies werewoven
around thegigantic figureoftheir firstleader and
thefounder oftheirreligion andwhich haveboth
hallowed andobscured thatfigure. Somefrag-
ments ofsound tradition which hadfound no
placeinthePentateuch mayliescattered inthat
material. One oftheselegendsdescribes inan
attractive fashion how theambition oftheman
Moses hadalready displayeditself inhischild-
hood.When Pharaoh tookhiminto hisarmsand
playfullytossed himhigh,the littlethree-year-
oldsnatched thecrown from Pharaoh's headand
placeditonhisown.Thekingwas startled at
thisomen andtook care toconsult hissages.1
1Thesame anecdote, slightly altered,istobefound inJosephus.
IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN53
Then, again, wearetoldofvictorious battles he
foughtasanEgyptian captaininEthiopia and,
inthesame connection, thathefledthecountry
because hehadreason tofear theenvy ofa
faction atcourt oreven theenvy ofPharaoh
himself. The Biblicalstoryitself lends Moses
certain features inwhich one isinclined tobelieve.
Itdescribes him ascholeric, hot-temperedas
when inhisindignationhekillsthebrutal over-
seerwho ill-treated aJewish workman, orwhen
inhisresentment atthedefection ofhispeople he
smashes thetables hehasbeengiven onMount
Sinai. Indeed, Godhimselfpunished himatlong
last foradeed ofimpatience wearenottold
what itwas. Since such atrait does notlend
itself toglorificationitmayverywellbehistorical
truth. Norcanwereject even thepossibility that
manycharacter traits theJews incorporatedinto
their early conceptionofGodwhentheymade
himjealous,stern andimplacable, were taken
aufondfrom theirmemory ofMoses, forintruth
itwasnotaninvisible god,butthemanMoses,
whohadledthem outofEgypt.
Another traitimputedtohim deserves our
specialinterest. Moses was said tohave been
"slow ofspeech"that istosay,hemusthave
hadaspeech impedimentorinhibition sothat
hehadtocallonAaron (whoiscalled hisbrother)
forassistance inhissupposeddiscussions with
Pharaoh. Thisagainmaybehistorical truthand
54MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
would serve asawelcome addition tothe
endeavour tomake thepictureofthisgreatman
live. Itmay, however, have another andmore
important significance. Thereport may,ina
slightlydistorted way,recall thefactthatMoses
spokeanother language andwasnotable to
communicate with hisSemiticNeo-Egyptians
without thehelpofaninterpreteratleast not
atthebeginningoftheir intercourse. Thus a
fresh confirmation ofthethesis: Moses wasan
Egyptian.
Itlooksnow asifthetrain ofthoughthascome
toanend, atleast forthetimebeing. From the
surmise thatMoses wasanEgyptian, be it
provenornot,nothing more canbededuced for
themoment. Nohistorian canregardtheBiblical
account ofMoses andtheExodus asother thana
pious myth, which transformed aremote tradi-
tion intheinterest ofitsown tendencies. How
thetradition ranoriginally wedonotknow.
What thedistorting tendencies wereweshould

ignoranceofthe historical events. That our
reconstruction leaves noroom forsomany

plagues,thepassage throughtheRed Sea, the

traces ofatradition totheeffect thatthefounder

rebellion ofhisstubborn andrefractory people.
Thereligion hehad instituted was atthesame
timeabandoned. This tradition isnotrestricted
toHosea :itrecurs inthewritingsofmost ofthe
laterprophets; indeed, accordingtoSellin,it
wasthebasis ofallthelaterexpectationsofthe
Messiah. Towards theendoftheBabylonian
exile thehopearoseamongtheJewish people
that themantheyhad socallously murdered
would return from therealm ofthedeadandlead
hiscontritepeople andperhapsnotonlyhis
peopleinto theland ofeternal bliss. The
palpableconnections with thedestiny ofthe
Founder ofalaterreligion donotlieinourpresent

however, wemayregardashistoricallycredible

fordoingso.And iftheyhavereally happened
thewish toforget them iseasily understood. We
need notaccept everydetail ofthetradition.
Sellin thinks thatShittim intheland eastofthe

thislocalitydoesnotaccord withourargument.
Letusadopt from Sellin thesurmise thatthe
EgyptianMoses was killed bytheJewsandthe
religion heinstituted abandoned. Itallows usto
spinourthread further withoutcontradicting the
trustworthyresults ofhistorical research. Butwe
venture tobeindependentofthehistorians in
otherrespects and toblaze ourown trail.The
Exodus from Egyptremains ourstarting-point.
Itmust have been aconsiderable number that
leftthecountry withMoses;asmallcrowd would
nothavebeenworth thewhile ofthatambitious
man, with hisgreat schemes. Theimmigrants
hadprobably been inthecountry longenough
todevelopintoanumerouspeople. We shall
certainlynotgoastray, however,ifwesuppose
with themajorityofresearch workers thatonlya
partofthosewho laterbecame theJewish people
hadundergonethefateofbondageinEgypt. In
other words, the tribereturning fromEgypt
combined later inthecountry betweenEgypt and
Canaan with other related tribes thathadbeen
settled there forsome time. This union, from
IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN 61
which wasborn thepeopleofIsrael, expressed
itself intheadoptionofanewreligion, common
toallthetribes, thereligion ofJahve; according
toE.Meyer,thiscame about inQades under
theinfluence oftheMidianites. Thereuponthe
peoplefeltstrong enoughtoundertake the
invasion ofCanaan. Itdoesnot fitinwith this
course ofevents thatthecatastrophetoMoses and
hisreligion should have takenplaceintheland
eastoftheJordanitmusthavehappenedalong
time before theunion.
Itiscertain thatmany verydiverse elements
contributed tothebuilding upoftheJewish
people,butthegreatestdifference among them
must have dependedonwhether they had
experiencedthesojourninEgypt andwhat
followedit,ornot.From thispointofviewwe
may saythat thenation wasmade upbythe
union oftwoconstituents, and itaccords with this
fact that, after ashortperiodofpolitical unity,
itbroke asunder intotwopartstheKingdom of
Israel andtheKingdom ofJudah. History loves
such restorations, inwhich later fusions arere-
dissolved andformerseparations become once
moreapparent. Themostimpressive example
averywell-known onewasprovided bythe
Reformation, when, after aninterval ofmore
than athousandyears,itbroughttolight again
thefrontier between theGermania thathadbeen
Roman andthepartthathadalways remained
62 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
independent. With theJewish people wecannot
verify suchafaithfulreproductionoftheformer
state ofaffairs. Ourknowledge ofthose times is
toouncertain topermittheassumptionthatthe
northern Kingdom hadabsorbed theoriginal
settlers, thesouthern thosereturning fromEgypt;
butthelater dissolution, inthiscase also,could
nothave been unconnected with the earlier
union. The formerEgyptianswereprobably
fewer than theothers, buttheyprovedtobeon
ahigherlevelculturally. Theyexercised amore
importantinfluence onthelaterdevelopmentof
thepeoplebecause theybrought withthem a
tradition theothers lacked.
Perhaps they brought something else,some-
thingmoretangible than atradition. Amongthe
greatestriddles ofJewish prehistorictimes isthat
concerningtheantecedents oftheLevites. They
aresaid tohave been derived from oneofthe
twelve tribes ofIsrael, thetribe ofLevi, butno
tradition hasever ventured topronounce on
where that tribeoriginally dwelt orwhatportion
oftheconquered country ofCanaan hadbeen
allotted toit.They occupiedthemostimportant
priestly positions, butyettheyweredistinguished
from thepriests. ALevite isnotnecessarilya
priest;itisnotthename ofacaste. Oursup-
positionabout thepersonofMosessuggests an
explanation.Itisnot credible that agreat
gentlemanliketheEgyptian Moses approached
IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN63
apeople strangetohimwithout anescort. He
must have broughthisretinue with him, his
nearest adherents, hisscribes, hisservants. These
were theoriginalLevites. Tradition maintains
thatMoses wasaLevite. Thisseems atransparent
distortion oftheactual state ofaffairs: the
Levites were Moses5
people.This solution is
supported bywhat Imentioned inmyprevious
essay:that inlater times wefindEgyptian
names onlyamongtheLevites.1Wemaysuppose
thatafairnumber oftheseMosespeople escaped
the fate that overtook himand hisreligion.
Theyincreased inthefollowing generations and
fused with thepeople among whomthey lived,
but they remained faithful totheir master,
honoured hismemory andretained thetradition
ofhisteaching. Atthetime oftheunion with
thefollowers ofJahve theyformed aninfluential
minority, culturally superiortothe rest.

blood relations after thesehadalready accepted
theJahve religionor before thathadhappened.
Perhapsthelatter ismorelikely.Itmakes no
difference tothefinal result. What happenedat
Qades wasacompromise,inwhich thepart
taken bytheMoses tribe isunmistakable.
Herewemaycallagain onthecustom of
circumcision which akind of"Leitfossil"
hasrepeatedlyrendered usimportantservices.
Thiscustom alsobecame thelawintheJahve
religion, and since itisinextricably connected
with Egyptitsadoption mustsignify acon-
cession tothepeopleofMoses. Theyorthe
Levites among them would notforgothissign
oftheir consecration. They wanted tosave so
much oftheir oldreligion, andforthatprice they
werewillingtorecognizethenewdeityand all
that theMidianpriests had tosayabout him.
Possibly theymanagedtoobtain stillother con-
cessions. Wehave already mentioned thatJewish
ritual ordains acertain economyintheuseofthe
name ofGod. Instead ofJahve theyhad tosay
Adonai. Itistemptingtofitthiscommandment
intoourargument, butthat ismerelyasurmise.
Theprohibition upon utteringthename ofGod
is,asiswellknown, aprimaevaltaboo. Why
exactlyitwasrenewed intheJewish command-
ments isnotquite clear;itisnot out ofthe
questionthat thishappened under theinfluence
ofanewmotive. There isnoreason tosuppose
IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN 65
thatthecommandment wasconsistently followed;
thewordJahve wasfreely used intheformation
ofpersonal theophorous names, i.e.incombina-
tions such asJochanan, Jehu, Joshua. Yetthere
issomething peculiar about thisname. It is
wellknown that Biblicalexegesis recognizes two
sources oftheHexateuch. They arecalledJand
Ebecause theoneusestheholyname ofJahve,
theother thatofElohim;Elohim,it is true, not
Adonai. Butwemay herequotetheremark of

Weadmitted theadherence tothecustom of

thenewreligionatQadesacompromise had
takenplace. What itconsisted inwelearn from
bothJandE;thetwoaccounts coincide and
must therefore goback toacommon source,
either awritten source oranoral tradition. The
guiding purpose was toprovethegreatness and
powerofthenewgodJahve. Since theMoses
peopleattached suchgreat importancetotheir
experienceoftheExodus from Egypt,thedeed of
freeing themhad tobeascribed toJahve;ithad
tobeadorned with features thatprovedthe
terrific grandeurofthisvolcano god,such as,for
example,thepillar ofsmoke which changedto

returningfloods ofwater. TheExodus andthe
founding ofthenewreligion were thusbrought
close togetherintime, thelonginterval between
them beingdenied. The bestowal oftheTen
Commandments toowassaidtohavetakenplace,
notatQades, butatthefootoftheHolyMoun-
tainamidst thesignsofavolcaniceruption. This
description, however, didaserious wrongtothe
memory ofthemanMoses;itwashe,andnot
thevolcano god,whohadfreed hispeople from
Egypt. Somecompensationwastherefore dueto
him,and itwasgiven bytransposing Moses to
Qadesortothemount Sinai-Horeb andputting
himintheplaceoftheMidianitepriest.Weshall
consider laterhow thissolution satisfied another,
irresistibly urgent, tendency. Byitsmeans a
balance, sotospeak, wasestablished :Jahve was
allowed toextend hisreach toEgypt from his
mountain inMidia, while theexistence and
activityofMoses were transferred toQades and
thecountryeastoftheJordan.This ishowhe
became onewith theperson who later established
areligion,theson-in-law ofthe Midianite
Jethro,theman towhom helent hisname Moses.
Weknow nothing personal, however, about this
other Moses heisentirely obscured bythefirst,
theEgyptian Mosesexcept possiblyfrom clues
provided bythecontradictions tobefound inthe
Bible inthecharacterization ofMoses. He is
oftenenough described asmasterful, hot-tempered,
IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN67
even violent, andyetitisalso said ofhim
thathewasthemostpatient andsweet-tempered
ofallmen. Itisclear that thelatterqualities
would havebeen ofnousetotheEgyptian Moses
whoplanned suchgreatand difficultprojectsfor
hispeople. Perhaps theybelongedtotheother,
theMidianite. Ithinkwearejustifiedinseparat-
ingthetwopersons from each other and in
assumingthat theEgyptian Moses never wasin
Qades andhadnever heard thename ofJahve,
whereas theMidianite Moses never setfoot in
Egypt andknew nothing ofAton. Inorder to
make thetwopeopleintoone, tradition orlegend
hadtobringtheEgyptian Moses toMidian;and
wehave seen thatmore than oneexplanation
wasgivenfor it.

Thedistortingtendencies wewant todetect
must have influenced thetraditions beforethey
were written down. Oneofthem, perhapsthe
strongestofall,wehave already discovered. We
saidthatwhen thenewgodJahveinQades was
instituted something had tobedone toglorify
him. Itistruer tosay:Hehadtobeestablished,
maderoom for; traces offormerreligions hadto
beextinguished. Thisseems tohave been done
successfully with thereligion ofthesettled tribes;
nomore washeard ofit.With thereturning
tribes thetaskwasnotsoeasy; theywere deter-
mined not tobedeprived oftheExodus from
Egypt,themanMoses andthecustom ofcircum-
cision. Itistruetheyhadbeen inEgypt,butthey
had left itagain, andfromnowoneverytrace of
Egyptianinfluence was tobedenied. Moses was
disposedofbydisplacing him toMidian and
Qades andmaking himintoonepersonwith the
priestwhofounded theJahve religion. Circum-
cision, themost compromising signofthe
dependence onEgypt, hadtoberetained, but,in
spiteofalltheexisting evidence, every endeavour
wasmade todivorce thiscustom from Egypt.
Theenigmatic passageinExodus, written inan
almost incomprehensible style, sayingthatGod
hadbeenwroth withMoses forneglectingcir-
cumcision andthat hisMidianite wifesaved his
lifebyaspeedy operation, canbeinterpreted

particularly clumsyinvention. Ifonewished

There wasyetanother purposeinbringingthe
patriarchsintothenewJahve religion. Theyhad
lived inCanaan; theirmemory wasconnected
with certain localities inthecountry. Possibly
theythemselves hadbeen Canaanite heroes or
local divinities whom theimmigratingIsraelites
hadadoptedfortheirearly history. Byevoking
them onegave proof,sotospeak,ofhaving been
bornandbred inthecountry, anddenied the
odium thatclingstothealienconqueror.Itwas
name Jochanaan, made upinpartfrom theHebrew wordJahve
andhaving arather similar meaningtothat ofGodfrey orits
Punic equivalent Hannibal, hasbecome oneofthemostpopular
names ofEuropean Christendom intheforms ofJohann, John,
Jean, Juan. When the Italians reproduceitintheshapeof
Giovanni andthen callonedayoftheweek Giovedi theybringto
light againasimilarity which perhaps means nothing orpossibly
means verymuch. Far-reaching possibilities, though very in-
secure ones, open out here. Inthose dark centuries which
historical research isonly beginning toexplore, thecountries
around theeastern basin oftheMediterranean were apparently
thescene offrequent andviolent volcanic eruptions which were
bound tomake thedeepest impression ontheinhabitants. Evans
supposesthat the final destruction ofthepalace ofMinos at
Knossos was also the result ofanearthquake. InCrete, as
probably everywhere inthe^Sgean world, thegreat Mother
Goddess wasthen worshipped. The observation that shewas
unable toguard herhouseagainsttheattack ofastronger power
might have contributed toherhavingtocedeherplacetoamale
deity, whereupon thevolcano godhadthe first right toreplace
her.Zeus stillbears thename of"theEarth -shaker." There is
hardlyadoubt that inthose obscure times mother deities were
replaced bymale gods (perhaps originallytheir sons). Specially

Inthelater contributions totheBiblical text
thetendencytoavoid mentioning Qades met
with success. The siteofthefounding ofthenew
religion definitely became thedivine mountains
Sinai-Horeb. Themotive isnotclearly visible;
perhaps theydidnotwant tobereminded ofthe
influence ofMidian. But alllaterdistortions,
especiallythose ofthePriestly Code, serve another
aim.There wasnolonger anyneed toalter ina
particulardirectiondescriptions ofhappenings of
long ago;thathadlongbeen done.Onthe
other hand, anendeavour wasmade todate
back toanearly time certain lawsand institu-
tions ofthepresent,tobasethem asaruleonthe
Mosaic lawandtoderive from thistheir claim to
holiness andbindingforce. However much the
pictureofpasttimes inthiswaybecamefalsified,
theproceduredoes notlackacertainpsycho-
logical justification.Itreflected thefactthat in
thecourse ofmany centuries about 800years
hadelapsed between theExodus andthefixation
oftheBiblical textbyEzraandNehemiah the
religionofJahve had followed aretrograde
developmentthathadculminated inafusion
(perhapstothepointofactualidentity) with the
original religion ofMoses.
And this istheessential outcome: thefateful
content ofthereligious history oftheJews.

fanciful;itisprobable enough. Moses, trained
inIkhnaton's school, employedthesamemethods

broughtnearer intime tothefounding oftheir
religioninthe oasis, andoneallowed Moses
instead oftheother founder tohelpinit,then
notonlywere theclaims oftheMoses people
satisfied, but thepainfulfact ofhisviolent
removal was alsosuccessfully denied. Inreality
itismost unlikelythatMoses could havepar-
ticipatedintheevents atQades, even ifhis life
hadnotbeen shortened.
Herewemusttrytoelucidate thesequenceof
these events. WehaveplacedtheExodus from
Egyptinthetime after theextinction ofthe
Eighteenth Dynasty (1350).Itmight have
happenedthen oralittle later, fortheEgyptian
chroniclers included thesubsequent years of
anarchyinthereignofHaremhab, thekingwho
broughtittoanendandwhoreigneduntil1315.
Thenext aidinfixingthechronology and itis
theonlyone isgiven bythesteleofMerneptah
(1225-1215),which extols thevictory over
Isiraal(Israel) andthedestruction oftheir seeds
(sic). Unfortunatelythevalue ofthis stele is
doubtful;itistaken tobeevidence that Israelite
tribes were atthat date alreadysettled in
Canaan.1E.Meyer rightly concludes from this
stele thatMerneptah could nothave been the
Pharaoh oftheExodus, asonehadpreviously
beenwont toassume. TheExodus mustbelong

IFMOSES WASANEGYPTIAN79
toanearlierperiod. Thequestion whowas
Pharaoh atthetime oftheExodusappearsto
meanidleone.There wasnoPharaoh atthat
time, because theExodus happened duringthe
interregnum. ButtheMerneptahstele doesnot
throw anylightonthepossibledateofthefusion
andtheacceptanceofthenewreligioninQades.
Allwecansaywithcertaintyisthatthey took
placesome timebetween 1350and1215. Within
thiscentury weassume theExodus tohavebeen
verynear tothe first date, theevents inQades
notfarfrom thesecond. Thegreater partofthe
period wewould reserve fortheinterval between
thetwo events. Afairly longtimewould be
necessaryforthepassionsofthereturningtribes
tocooldown after themurder ofMoses and for
theinfluence oftheMosespeople,theLevites, to
havebecome sostrongasthecompromisein
Qades presupposes. Twogenerations, sixty years,
might suffice, butonly just.Thedate inferred
from thesteleofMerneptahfallstooearly, and
asweknow thatinourhypothesis oneassumption
onlyrestsonanother wehave toadmit that this
discussion shows aweakspotintheconstruction.
Unfortunately everything connected with the
settling oftheJewish peopleinCanaan ishighly
obscure andconfused. Wemight, ofcourse, use

thatthepeople, probablyafteraveryshort time,
renounced theteachingofMoses andremoved

and itsinfluence reached though only slowly,
inthecourse ofcenturies theaim thatwas
denied toMoses himself. ThegodJahve attained

SECTION I
i.TheHistorical Premisses
The historical backgroundoftheevents which
have aroused ourinterest isasfollows. Through
theconquests oftheEighteenth Dynasty Egypt
hadbecome aworldEmpire. ThenewIm-
perialism was reflected inthedevelopmentof
certainreligious ideas,ifnotinthose ofthewhole
people, yetinthose ofthegoverning and in-
tellectually active upperstratum. Under the
MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
influence ofthepriestsoftheSunGod atOn
(Heliopolis), possibly strengthened bysuggestions
from Asia, there arose theideaofauniversal God
Aton nolongerrestricted toonepeople andone
country. With theyoung Amenhotep IV(who
laterchangedhisname toIkhnaton)aPharaoh
succeeded tothethrone whoknew nohigherin-
terest than indevelopingtheideaofsuchaGod.
Heraised theAtonreligiontotheofficialreligion
andtherebytheuniversal Godbecame theOnly
God;allthatwassaidoftheother godsbecame
deceit andguile. With asuperb implacability he
resisted allthetemptationsofmagical thought
anddiscarded theillusion, dearparticularlyto
theEgyptians,ofalifeafter death. Withanaston-
ishing premonitionoflater scientific knowledge

(truth andjustice).
Itisthe first case inthehistoryofmankind,
andperhapsthepurest,ofamonotheisticreligion.Adeeper knowledge ofthehistorical andpsycho-
logicalconditions ofitsorigin would beof
inestimable value. Care was taken, however,
thatnotmuch information concerning theAton
religion should comedown tous.Already under
thereignofIkhnaton's weak successorseverything
hehad created broke down. Thepriesthood
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 97
hehadsuppressedvented theirfuryonhis
memory. TheAtonreligion wasabolished; the
capitaloftheheretic Pharaoh demolished and
pillaged.In13506.0. theEighteenth Dynasty
wasextinguished;afteraninterval ofanarchy
thegeneral Haremhab, whoreigneduntil1315,
restored order. Ikhnaton's reforms seemed tobe
butanepisode, doomed tobeforgotten.
This iswhat hasbeen establishedhistorically
and atthispoint ourwork ofhypothesis begins.
Among theintimates ofIkhnaton wasamanwho
wasperhapscalled Thothrnes, as somany others
were atthattime;lthename doesnotmatter,
but itssecondpartmust havebeen -mose. He
heldhigh rank,andwasaconvinced adherent of
theAtonreligion, butincontradistinction tothe
brooding King hewas forceful andpassionate.
For thisman thedeath ofIkhnaton andthe
abolishingofhisreligion meant theendofallhis
hopes. Only proscribedorrecanting could he
remain inEgypt.Ifheweregovernor ofaborder

had leftEgyptwiththem accompanied byhis
immediate followers hehallowed them bythe
custom ofcircumcision, gavethem lawsand
introduced them totheAtonreligion which the
Egyptianshadjustdiscarded.Perhapstherules
themanMoses imposed onhisJews were even
harder than those ofhismaster and teacher
Ikhnaton; perhaps healsorelinquishedthe
connection with theSunGodofOn,towhom the
latter had stilladhered.
FortheExodus from Egypt wemust fixthe
time oftheinterregnumafter1350. The sub-
sequent periodsoftime, untilpossession was
taken oftheland ofCanaan, areespecially
obscure. Outofthedarkness which theBiblical
Text hashere left orrather created thehis-
torical research ofourdayscandistinguish two
facts. Thefirst, discovered byE.Sellin,isthat
theJews,whoeven accordingtotheBible were
stubborn andunruly towards theirlaw-giver
andleader, rebelled atlast, killedhimandthrew
offtheimposed AtonreligionastheEgyptians
haddone before them. Thesecondfact,proved
byE.Meyer,isthat theseJewsontheir return
fromEgyptunited with tribesnearlyrelated to
them, inthecountry bordering onPalestine, the
Sinaipeninsula andArabia, andthat there, in
afertilespotcalledQades, theyaccepted under
theinfluence oftheArabian Midianites anew
religion,theworshipofthevolcano GodJahve.

Soon after thisthey were readytoconquer
Canaan.
Therelationshipintimeofthesetwoevents to
each other and totheExodus isvery uncertain.
Thenext historical allusion isgiveninasteleof
thePharaoh Merneptah, whoreigneduntil1215,
which numbers"Israel"amongthevanquished
inhisconquestsinSyria and Palestine. Ifwe
take thedate ofthis stele asaterminus adquern
there remains forthewhole course ofevents,
starting from theExodus, about acentury
after 1350until before1215.Itispossible,
however, thatthename Israel doesnotyetrefer
tothetribes whose fateweareherefollowing and
that inreality wehave alonger periodatour
disposal. ThesettlingofthelaterJewish people
inCanaan wascertainly not aswiftlyachieved
conquest;itwas rather aseries ofsuccessive
struggles andmusthave stretched overalongish
period.Ifwediscard therestriction imposed by

IOO MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
asIhaveshown inmylastessay goodreason to
shorten theinterval between theExodus andthe
foundation ofareligioninQades ;ourargument
would incline ustofavour thecontrary.
Tillnowwehavebeenconcerned with theex-
ternalaspectsofthestory, withanattempttofill
inthegapsofourhistorical knowledgeinpart
arepetitionofmysecondessay. Our interest
follows thefateofMoses and hisdoctrines, to
which therevolt oftheJews onlyapparently put
anend.From theJahvist account written down
about IOOOB.C., thoughdoubtless founded on
earlier material wehave learned thattheunion
ofthe tribes andfoundation ofareligionin
Qades representedacompromise,thetwoparts
ofwhich are stilleasily distinguishable. One
partner wasconcerned onlyindenyingthe
recency andforeignnessoftheGodJahve and
inheighteninghisclaim tothepeople'sdevotion.
Theotherpartner would notrenounce memories,
sodear tohim,oftheliberation fromEgypt and
themagnificent figure ofhisleader Moses; and,
indeed, hesucceeded infindingaplaceforthe
factaswell asfortheman inthenewrepresenta-
tionofJewish early history,inretainingatleast
theoutersignoftheMosesreligion, namely
circumcision, andininsisting oncertain restric-
tions intheuseofthenewdivine name. Ihave
said that thepeople who insisted onthose
demands were thedescendants oftheMoses
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION IOI
followers, theLevites, separated byafewgenera-
tions onlyfrom theactualcontemporaries and
compatriotsofMoses andattached tohismemory
byatradition stillgreen. Thepoeticallyelabor-
atedaccounts attributed totheJahvist andtohis
latercompetitortheElohist, arelikegravestones,
under which thetruthabout thoseearlymatters
thenature oftheMosaicreligion andtheviolent
removal ofthegreatman truths withdrawn
from theknowledgeoflatergenerations, should,
sotospeak,belaid toeternal rest.And ifwe
have divined arightthecourse ofevents, there is
nothing mysterious about them;itmight very
well, however, havebeen thedefinite endofthe
MosesepisodeinthehistoryoftheJewish people.
Theremarkable thing about itisthat thiswas
not so,that themost importanteffects ofthat
experienceshould appear much laterandshould
inthecourse ofmanycenturies graduallyforce
theirwaytoexpression.Itisnotlikelythat
Jahve wasverydifferent incharacter from the
godsoftheneighbouring peoples and tribes; he
wrestled with theothergods,itistrue, justas
thetribes fought among themselves, yetwemay
assume thataJahve worshipperofthat time
would never havedreamt ofdoubtingtheexis-
tence ofthegodsofCanaan, Moab, Amalek and
soon,anymore thanhewould theexistence of
thepeople who believed inthem. Themono-
theistic idea,which hadblazed upinIkhnaton's
IO2 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
time, wasagainobscured andwas toremain in
darkness foralongtime tocome.Ontheisland
Elephantine,close tothe first Nile cataract,
discoveries have yieldedtheastonishing informa-
tion thataJewish military colony,settled there
centuries ago,worshippedintheirtemplesbesides
their chiefgodJahu twofemaledeities, oneof
whom wascalled Anat-Jahu. Those Jews,it is
true,hadbeenseparatedfrom themothercountry
andhadnotgone throughthesamereligious
development;thePersian government (inthe
fifth century B.C.)communicated tothem the
newceremonialregulationsofJerusalem.1Re-
turningtoearlier timeswemay surely saythat
Jahve wasquiteunlike theMosaic God.Aton
hadbeen apacifist,like hisdeputy onearth
orrather hismodel thePharaoh Ikhnaton, who
looked onwith folded arms astheEmpirehis
ancestors hadwon felltopieces. Forapeople
thatwaspreparingtoconquer new lands by
violence Jahve wascertainlybetter suited. More-
over,whatwasworthyofhonour intheMosaic
Godwasbeyondthecomprehensionofaprimitive
people.
Ihave already mentioned and inthis Iam
supported bytheopinionofother workers
thatthecentral factofthedevelopmentofJewish
religion was this: inthecourse oftimeJahve
losthisowncharacter andbecame moreandmore

likethe old God ofMoses, Aton. Differences
remained,itistrue,andatfirstsight theywould
seem important; yetthey areeasytoexplain.
AtonhadbegunhisreigninEgyptinahappy
periodofsecurity, andevenwhen theEmpire
begantoshake initsfoundations hisfollowers
hadbeen able toturnaway fromworldlymatters
and tocontinuepraising and enjoyinghis
creations. TotheJewish peoplefate dealt a
series ofsevere trialsandpainful experiences,so
theirGodbecame hard, relentless and, asitwere,
wrappedingloom. Heretained thecharacter of
anuniversal Godwhoreigned over alllandsand
peoples;''the fact,however, that hisworship had
passedfrom theEgyptianstotheJews found its
expressionintheadded doctrine that theJews
were hischosenpeople, whosespecial obligations
would intheendfind theirspecialreward. It
might nothave beeneasyforthat peopleto

ceremonial forhisworship,found themselves in
oppositiontostrongtendencies within thepeople
which endeavoured torevive twoother doctrines
ofMoses about hisGod. Theprophets'voices
untiringly proclaimedthatGod disdained cere-
monial and sacrifice andasked nothing buta
belief inHimandalifeintruth andjustice.
When they praisedthesimplicity andholiness of
their lifeinthedesert they surely stood under the
influence ofMosaic ideals.
Itistimenow toraise thequestion whether
there isanyneed atalltoinvoke Moses' influence
onthe finalshapeoftheJewish idea oftheir
God, whether it is notenoughtoassume a
spontaneous developmenttoahigher spirituality
during acultural lifeextending overmany
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION105
centuries. On thispossible explanation, which
would putanend toallourguessing,Iwould
maketwocomments. First that itdoesnotexplain
anything. Thesame conditions didnotlead to
monotheism with theGreekpeople, whowere
surely mostgifted, buttoabreaking upofpoly-
theisticreligion and tothebeginning ofphilo-
sophical thought.InEgypt monotheism had
grownasfarasweunderstand itsgrowthas
anancillaryeffect ofimperialism ;Godwasthe
reflection ofaPharaohautocratically governing
agreat worldempire. With theJews thepolitical
conditions weremostunfavourable foradevelop-
mentaway from theideaofanexclusive national
God towards thatofanuniversal ruler ofthe
world. Whence then didthistinyandimpotent
nation derive theaudacitytopassthemselves off
forthefavourite child oftheSovereign Lord ?
Thequestionoftheoriginofmonotheism among
theJewswould thusremain unanswered orelse
onewould have tobecontent with thecurrent
answer that itwastheexpressionoftheirpar-
ticularreligious genius. Weknow thatgenius
isincomprehensible andunaccountable and it
should therefore notbecalled uponasan
explanationuntil every other solution hasfailed.1
Furthermore, there isthe fact thatJewish

bystating emphatically and thistimewithout
contradictingthemselves that theidea ofan
OnlyGodwasgiventothepeople byMoses.
Ifthere isanobjectiontothetrustworthiness of
thisstatement,itisthat thepriestsintheir re-
writing oftheBiblical Text aswehaveit,ascribe
much toomuch toMoses. Institutions, aswell
asritualistic rules, undoubtedly belongingto
later times, aredeclared tobeMosaic laws, with
theclear intention ofenhancingtheirauthority.
This iscertainlyareason forsuspicion, yethardly
enoughforustouse.Forthedeeper motive of
suchanexaggerationisclear asdaylight. The
priests,intheaccountsthey present,desired to
establish acontinuity between theirown times
andtheMosaicperiod. They attemptedtodeny
justthatwhich wehave recognizedtobethe
moststrikingfeature ofJewish religious history,
namely,that there was agapbetween the
Mosaic law-giving andthelaterJewish religion
agapfilled inatfirstbytheworshipofJahve and
onlylaterslowly covered over. Theirpresenta-
tiondenies thissequenceofevents with allthe
means initspower, althoughitshistorical cor-
rectness isbeyondalldoubt, sincethroughoutthe
peculiar treatment theBiblical Text hasunder-
gonethere remain more thanenough statements
inproofofit.Thepriests'version hadanaim
similar tothatofthetendency which made the
newgodJahvetheGodofthePatriarchs. Ifwe
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION107
take intoconsideration thismotive ofthePriestly
Code itishard nottobelieve that itwasreally
Moses whogavehisJewsthemonotheistic idea.
Weshould find ittheeasier togiveassent tothis
sinceweareable tosayfrom where theidea
came toMoses something which theJewish
priesthood hadcertainly forgotten.
Here, someone might ask,whatdowegainby
deriving Jewish monotheism from theEgyptians?
Theproblemhasthusonlybeenputback astep;
weknow nomore about thegenesisofthemono-
theistic idea. Theanswer isthat itisnota

weshall learn something byelucidatingthereal

Ithus believe thattheideaofanOnlyGod, as
well astheemphasislaidonethical demands in

which atfirstfound nohearing butcame into
theirown after alongspaceoftimeandfinally

phenomena?
Ournext reflection tellsusthattheyareoften

probably come about invarious wayswhich are

At first itmeets with hostilerejection and is
violentlydebated fordecades;ittakes onlyone

accorded thehonour ofburial inWestminster

there isacorrespondenceinonepoint.Itis
IIO MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
thefeature which onemight termlatency. There
arethebestgroundsforthinkingthat inthe
historyoftheJewish religionthere isalong
periodafter thebreaking away from theMoses
religion during which notrace istobe found
ofthemonotheistic idea, thecondemnation of
ceremonial andtheemphasis ontheethical side.
Thuswearepreparedforthepossibilitythatthe
solution ofourproblemistobesoughtina
special psychologicalsituation.
Ihavemore than once traced theevents in
Qades when thetwocomponentsofthelater
Jewish people combined intheacceptanceofa
newreligion. With thosewhohadbeen in
Egyptthememory oftheExodus andofthe
figureofMoses was stillsostrong andvivid that
itinsisted onbeing incorporatedintoanyaccount
oftheirearly history. Theremight have been
among them grandsonsofpersons whothemselves
hadknown Moses, andsome ofthem still felt
themselves tobeEgyptians andboreEgyptian
names. They hadgood reasons, however, for
"
repressing"thememory ofthefatethathad
befallen their leader andlaw-giver. For the
othercomponentofthetribe theleading motive
wastoglorifythenewGodanddenyhisforeign-
ness. Bothparties wereequally concerned to
denythattherehadbeenanearlierreligion and
especially what itcontained. This ishow the
firstcompromise came about, whichprobably
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION III
wassoon codified inwriting; thepeople from
Egypt hadbrought withthem theartofwriting
and thefondness forwriting history. Along
time was toelapse, however, before historians
came todevelop anideal ofobjectivetruth. At
firstthey shapedtheir accountsaccordingto
their needs andtendencies ofthemoment, with
aneasy conscience, asiftheyhadnotyetunder-
stoodwhat falsificationsignified. Inconsequence,
adifference begantodevelop between the
written version and theoralreport,i.e.the
tradition, ofthesamesubject-matter. What has
been deleted oraltered inthewritten version
might quitewellhavebeenpreserved uninjured
inthetradition. Tradition wasthecomplement
and atthesame time thecontradiction ofthe
writtenhistory.Itwas lesssubjecttodistorting
influencesperhapsinpart entirelyfreeofthem
andtherefore might bemore truthful than the
account setdown inwriting.Itstrustworthiness,
however, wasimpaired bybeing vaguer andmore
fluidthan thewritten text,being exposedtomany
changes anddistortions asitwaspassed onfrom
onegenerationtotheother byword ofmouth.
Such atradition mayhave different outcomes.
Themostlikely event would befor ittobe
vanquished bythewritten version, ousted by it,
until itgrows moreandmoreshadowy andatlast
isforgotten. Another fatemight bethat the
tradition itself ends bybecoming awritten
112 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
version. There areotherpossibilitieswhich will
bementioned later.
Thephenomenonofthelatency periodinthe
historyoftheJewish religion mayfind itsexplana-
tion inthis :thefactswhich theso-called official
written history purposelytried tosuppresswere
inrealitynever lost.Theknowledgeofthem
survived intraditions which were keptalive
amongthepeople. AccordingtoE.Sellin, there
even existed atradition concerningtheendof
Moses which contradicted outrightthe official
account andcame farnearer tothetruth. The
same thing, wemay suppose, happenedwith
other beliefs thathadapparentlyfound anend
atthesame time asMoses, doctrines ofthe
Mosaic religionthathadbeen unacceptableto
themajorityofMoses5
contemporaries.
Herewemeet with aremarkable fact. Itis
that these traditions instead ofgrowingweaker
astimewentongrewmoreandmorepowerful
inthecourse ofcenturies, found theirwayinto
thelater codifications oftheofficial accounts, and
atlastprovedthemselves strong enough decisively
toinfluence thethought and activityofthe
people. What theconditions were thatmade
such adevelopment possible seems, however, far
from evident.
This fact isindeed strange,somuch sothat
wefeeljustifiedinexaminingitafresh. Within
itourproblemlies.TheJewish people had
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 113
abandoned theAtonreligion which Moses had
given them andhadturned totheworshipof
another godwho differed littlefrom theBaalim
oftheneighbouringtribes. Allthe efforts of
later distortinginfluences failed tohide this
humiliatingfact. YetthereligionofMoses did
notdisappearwithout leaving anytrace; akind
ofmemoryofithadsurvived, atradition perhaps
obscured and distorted. Itwas thistradition of
agreat pastthatcontinued to.work intheback-
ground,until itslowly gained more andmore
powerover themind ofthepeople and atlast
succeeded intransformingtheGodJahveinto
theMosaic Godandinwakingtoanew lifethe

which had laterbeen forsaken. That adormant
tradition should exert suchapowerfulinfluence
onthespirituallifeofapeopleisnotafamiliar
conception.Therewefindourselves inadomain
ofmasspsychologywherewedonotfeelathome.
Wemust lookaround foranalogies,forfacts of
asimilar nature even ifinotherdisciplines. We
shall findthem, Iamsure.
When thetimewasripeningforareturn ofthe
religionofMoses, theGreek people possessed an
exceptionallyrichtreasure oflegends andmyths
ofheroes. Itisbelieved thattheninth oreighth
centuryB.C.saw thecreation oftheHomeric
epics which derived their material from this
complexofmyths. With our psychological
H
114 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
knowledgeofto-day wecouldlongbefore
Schliemann andEvans have putthequestion:
whence didtheGreeks obtain allthismaterial
ofmyths andlegends whichHomer andthegreat
Attic dramatists transformed intoimmortal works
ofart?Theanswer would havehad tobe :this
people probably passedinitsearly history through
aperiodofoutward splendour andhighly
developedculture which ended incatastrophe
as,indeed, historytells andofwhich afaint
tradition lived onintheselegends. Archaeo-
logicalresearch ofourdays hasconfirmed this
suggestion, which ifmade earlier wouldsurely
havebeen considered toobold. Ithasdiscovered
theevidence ofthegrandiose Minoan -Mycenaean
culture which hadprobably already come to
an end on theGreek mainland by1250B.C.
TheGreek historians ofalaterperiod hardly
ever refer toit.There istheremark that there
wasatimewhen theCretans ruled thesea,a
mention ofthename ofKing Minos and his
palace, andofthelabyrinth; butthat isall.
Nothing remained ofthatgreat time butthe
traditions seized upon bythegreatwriters.
Otherpeoplesalsopossess suchfolk-epics,for
example,theIndians, Finns andGermans. It
isfortheliteraryhistorian toinvestigate whether
thesame conditions aswith theGreeksapplied
there aswell. Ithink thatsuchaninvestigation
wouldyield apositiveresult. Theconditions we

therefore, need notsurprise us,andtheanalogy
wehavefound ofthedependence ofepicpoetry
onpreciseconditions willmake usmore inclined
toacceptthestrange suggestionthatwith the
Jewsitwasthetradition ofMoses which turned
theJahve worshipinthedirection oftheold
Mosaicreligion. Thetwo cases, however, are
verydifferent inotherrespects.Intheonethe
result ispoetry,intheother areligion, andwe
haveassumed thatthelatter under thestimulus
ofatradition wasreproduced withafaithfulness
forwhich, ofcourse, theepiccannot providea
parallel. Enough remains, therefore, ofour
problemtoencourage asearch forbetteranalogies.
3.TheAnalogy
The only really satisfactory analogytothe
remarkableprocess which wehave recognizedin
thehistoryofJewish religionistobefound ina
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 117
domainapparently remote fromourproblem.It
is,however, very complete, approximatingto
identity. Hereagainwefind thephenomenon
oflatency, theappearanceofinexplicable
manifestations which call foranexplanation,
andthe strict condition ofanearly, andsubse-
quently forgotten, experience.Here toowefind
thecharacteristic ofcompulsiveness, which
overpowering logical thinking strongly engages
thepsychical life;itisatraitwhich wasnot
concerned inthegenesis oftheepic.
Thisanalogyismetwith inpsychopathology,
inthegenesisofhuman neurosis :that istosay,
inadiscipline belongingtoindividualpsychology,
whereasreligious phenomena must ofcourse be
regardedasapartofmasspsychology. Weshall
seethat thisanalogyisnot sostartlingasit
appearsatfirstsight; indeed,itisrather inthe
nature ofanaxiom.
Theimpressions weexperiencedatanearly age
andforgot later, towhich Ihave ascribed such
great importancefortheaetiology oftheneuroses,
arecalled traumata. Itmayremain anopen
question whether theaetiology oftheneuroses
should ingeneral beregardedasatraumatic one.
Theobviousobjectionisthatatrauma isnot
alwaysevident intheearly historyoftheneurotic
individual. Oftenwemustbecontent tosaythat

Il8 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
individuals; many peopledeal withthem in
another waywhichwemaytermnormal. Where
wecanfindnootherexplanation thananheredit-
aryandconstitutionaldisposition wearenaturally
temptedtosaythattheneurosis wasnotsuddenly
acquiredbutslowly developed.
Inthisconnection, however, twopoints stand
out.The first isthatthegenesis oftheneurosis
always goesback tovery early impressionsin
childhood.1Thesecond isthis: itiscorrect to
saythat there arecaseswhich wesingleoutas
"traumatic"onesbecause theeffects unmistak-
ablygoback tooneormorestrong impressions
ofthisearly period. Theyfailed tobedisposed
ofnormally,sothatone feels inclined tosay:if
thisorthathadnothappened,therewould have
beennoneurosis. Itwould besufficient forour
purposeseven ifwehad tolimit theanalogyin
questiontothese traumatic cases. Yetthegap
between thetwogroupsdoesnotseem unbridge-
able. Itisquite possibletocombine both aetio-
logical conditions inoneconception ;alldepends
onwhat isdefined astraumatic. Ifwemay
assume thatanexperience acquiresitstraumatic

HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION Iig
liesinitshaving made toomany demands onthe
personalitythenwecanformulate thecon-
clusion that with one constitutionsomething
producesatrauma whereas withanother itdoes
not.Wethenhave theconceptionofasliding
scale, aso-called complemental series, where two
factors convergetocompletetheaetiology; a
minus inonefactor iscompensated byaplusin
theother. Generallythetwofactors worktogether
andonlyateither endoftheseries canwespeak
ofasimplemotivation. Inconsequence ofthis
reasoning wecan leave outofaccount the
difference between traumatic andnon-traumatic
aetiologyasbeing unimportantforouranalogy.
Despite some riskofrepetition,itmay be
useful togroup togetherthefactsrelatingtothe
important analogyinquestion. Theyare as
follows. Our researches haveshown thatwhat
wecallthephenomenaorsymptomsofaneurosis
aretheconsequencesofcertainexperiences and
impressions which, forthisvery reason, werecog-
nize tobeaetiological traumata. Wewish to
ascertain, even ifonlyinarough schematic way,
thecharacteristics common totheseexperiences
andtoneurotic symptoms.
Letusfirst consider theformer. Allthese
traumata belongtoearly childhood, theperiod
uptoabout fiveyears. Impressions duringthe
timewhen thechildbeginstospeakarefound to
beespecially interesting. Theperiod between two
ISO MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
andfouryearsisthemostimportant. How soon
after birth thissensitiveness totraumatabegins
wearenotable tostate withanydegree of
certainty.
Theexperiencesinquestionare asarule
entirely forgotten andremain inaccessible to
memory. They belongtotheperiodofinfantile
amnesia which isofteninterrupted byisolated
fragmentary memories, theso-called"screen-
memories.55
They concernimpressionsofasexual and
aggressivenature and alsoearly injuriestothe
self(injuriestonarcissism).Weshould addthat
children atthatearly agedonotyetdistinguish
between sexual andpurely aggressive actions so
clearlyastheydolater on; (the"sadistic"mis-
understandingofthesexual actbelongstothis
context).Itisofcoursevery strikingthat the
sexual factor should predominate andtheory
must take thisintoaccount.
These threepoints early happeningswithin
the first fiveyears oflife,theforgetting, andthe
characteristic ofsexuality andaggressivity
belong closely together. Thetraumata areeither
bodily experiencesorperceptions, especiallythose
heard orseen; that istosay,theyareeither
experiencesorimpressions. What connects the
threepointsisestablishedtheoretically, by
analytic work; thisalone canyield aknowledge
oftheforgotten experiences,ortoputitmore
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 121
concretely, though moreincorrectlyisable to
bringthoseforgotten experiences back tomemory.
The theory says that, contrarytopopular
opinion, human sexual life orwhat later cor-
responds with itshows anearly blossoming
which comes toanendatabout theageoffive.
Then follows the so-calledlatency period
lasting uptopuberty during which there isno
further sexualdevelopment; onthecontrary,
much thathadbeenachieved undergoesaretro-
gression. Thetheoryisconfirmed byanatomical
studyofthegrowthoftheinternalgenitalia;
itsuggeststhatman isderived from aspeciesof
animal thatwassexually mature atfiveyears,
andarouses thesuspicionthatthepostponement,
andthebeginningtwice over, ofsexual lifehas
much todowith thetransition tohumanity.
Man seems tobetheonlyanimal withalatency
period anddelayed sexuality. Investigations of
primates, which sofarasIknow have notbeen
made, would furnish aninvaluable testforthis
theory.Itmust besignificant psychologically
that theperiodofinfantile amnesia coincides
with thisearly blossomingofsexuality. Perhaps
thisstateofaffairs isanecessarycondition forthe
existence ofneurosis, which seems tobeahuman
privilege,andwhich inthislight appearstobe
asurvival fromprimaevaltimes like certain
partsofourbody.
What features arecommon toallneurotic
122 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
symptoms?Herewemay notetwoimportant
points. The effects ofthetrauma aretwofold,
positive andnegative. Theformer areendeavours
torevive thetrauma, toremember theforgotten
experience, or,betterstill, tomake itreal
toliveoncemore througharepetitionofit;if

These endeavours aresummed upintheterms

tertraits, althoughorrather because their

Thesenegativereactions also contribute con-
siderablytotheformation ofcharacter.Actually
they representfixations onthetrauma noless
thandothepositive reactions, butthey follow
theopposite tendency. Thesymptomsofthe
neurosisproperconstitute acompromiseto
which both thepositive andnegativeeffects of
thetrauma contribute; sometimes onecom-
ponent, sometimes the other, predominates.
Theseoppositereactions create conflicts which
thesubject cannot asarule resolve.
Thesecondpointisthis. Allthesephenomena,

then thesovereignty ofaninnerpsychical reality
124 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM

doesnotcome tothis, thepractical importance
oftheconflict isimmeasurable. The inhibitions,
oreveninabilitytodeal withlife,ofpeople
dominated byneurosis areavery important
factor inhumansociety. The neurosis maybe
regardedasadirectexpressionofa"fixation"
toanearly periodoftheirpast.
Andhowaboutlatency,aquestion especially
interestinginregardtoouranalogy?Atrauma
inchildhood canbeimmediately followed bya
neurosis during childhood; this constitutes an
effort ofdefence accompanied bytheformation
ofsymptoms. Theneurosis maylastalongtime
andcausestriking disturbances, oritmayremain
latent andbeoverlooked. Asarule, defence
obtains theupperhand insuchaneurosis;inany
event changes ofthepersonality remain like
scars.Achildhood neurosis seldom continues
without aninterval intotheneurosis oftheadult.
Much more often itissucceeded byatime of
undisturbed development, aprocess madepossible
orfacilitated bythephysiological latency. Only
later does thechange appear withwhich the
neurosis becomesdefinitely manifest asadelayed
effect ofthetrauma. This happenseither at
pubertyorsomewhat later. Inthe firstcase it
comes about because theinstinctsstrengthened by
physical maturity canagaintakeupthebattle
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION125
inwhich atfirsttheywere defeated. Inthesecond
casetheneurosis becomes manifest later because
thereactions andchanges ofthepersonality
brought about bythedefence mechanismsprove
tobeanobstacle forthesolvingofnewproblems
oflife, sothatgraveconflicts arisebetween the
demands oftheouter world andthose oftheEgo,
which strives topreservetheorganizationithad
painfully developedinitsdefensivestruggle. The
phenomenonofalatencyintheneurosis between
the first reactions tothetrauma and thelater
appearanceoftheillness must berecognizedas
typical. The illnessmayalsoberegardedasan

sought, andeventhennotalways. Often itends
inentirely destroying andbreaking uptheEgoor

wasearly split off,andhassincebeendominated,
bythetrauma.
Toconvince thereader of thetruth ofour
statements theexhaustive communication of
several neurotic lifehistories would benecessary.
Thedifficultyofthesubject, however, would lead
togreatdiscursiveness andentirely destroythe
character ofthisessay.Itwould become a
treatise ontheneuroses andeven thenwould
126 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
enforce conviction only onthat minority of

Nevertheless Icantrytorelate one case
which willshow clearly many ofthepeculiari-

His sexual activities remained restricted to

material: thiswastheformula wedrewupfor

invite thereader totake astepforward and
assume that inthehistoryofthehumanspecies
something happenedsimilar totheevents inthe
lifeoftheindividual. That istosay,mankind
asawhole alsopassed throughconflicts ofa
sexual -aggressive nature, which leftpermanent
traces butwhich were forthemost partwarded
offandforgotten; later, after along periodof
latency, theycame tolifeagain and created
phenomenasimilar instructure andtendencyto
neurotic symptoms.
Ihave,Ibelieve, divined theseprocesses and
wish toshow that their consequences, which
bearastrongresemblance toneurotic symptoms,
arethephenomenaofreligion.Since itcanno
longer bedoubted after thediscovery ofevolution
130MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
thatmankind hadapre-history, and since this
historyisunknown(thatistosay, forgotten),
suchaconclusion hasalmost thesignificance of
anaxiom. Ifweshould learn thattheeffective
andforgotten traumata relate, here aswell as
there, tolifeinthehumanfamily, weshould
greetthisinformation asahighly welcome and
unforeseengiftwhich could nothave been
anticipatedfrom theforegoingdiscussion.
Ihave already upheldthis thesis aquarterofa
century ago,inmybook Totem andTaboo(1912),
andneedonly repeat what Isaid there. The
argumentstarted fromsome remarks byCharles
Darwin andembraced asuggestionofAtkinson's.
Itsaysthatinprimaevaltimesmen lived insmall
hordes, eachunder thedomination of astrong
male.When thiswas isnotknown; nopoint of
contact withgeological datahasbeen established.
Itislikely thatmankind wasnotveryfaradvanced
intheartofspeech. Anessentialpartofthe
argumentisthat allprimaeval men, including,
therefore,allourancestors, underwent thefate
Ishallnow describe.
Thestoryistold inaverycondensed way,as
ifwhat inreality took centuries toachieve, and
duringthatlongtimewasrepeated innumerably,
hadonlyhappenedonce. Thestrong malewas
themaster andfather ofthewhole horde: un-
limited inhispower, which heusedbrutally.All
females were hisproperty,thewivesanddaughters
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION
inhisownhorde aswell asperhapsalsothose
robbed from other hordes. The fateofthesons
wasahard one;iftheyexcited thefather's
jealousy theywere killed orcastrated ordriven
out.Theywere forced tolive insmall com-
munities and toprovidethemselves with wives
byrobbing them from others. Then oneorthe
other sonmight succeed inattainingasituation
similar tothatofthefather intheoriginalhorde.
Onefavouredposition came about inanatural
way:itwas that oftheyoungestsonwho,
protected byhismother's love, couldprofit by
hisfather's advancing years andreplace him
after hisdeath. Anecho oftheexpulsionofthe
eldest son, aswell asofthefavouredpositionof
theyoungest,seems tolingerinmany myths and
fairytales.
Thenext decisivesteptowards changingthis
firstkind of"social"
organizationliesinthe
following suggestion. The brothers whohad
been driven outand livedtogetherinacom-
munity clubbedtogether, overcame thefather
and accordingtothecustom ofthose times
allpartookofhisbody.This cannibalism need
notshock us;itsurvived into farlater times.
The essentialpoint is,however, thatweattribute
tothoseprimaeval peoplethesamefeelings and
emotions thatwehave elucidated intheprimitives
ofourown times, our children, bypsycho-
analyticresearch. That istosay:theynotmerely
132MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
hated andfeared their father, butalsohonoured
him asanexampletofollow; infacteach son
wanted toplacehimself inhisfather'sposition.
The cannibalistic actthusbecomescomprehen-
sible asanattempttoassure one's identification
with thefather byincorporatingapartofhim.
Itisareasonable surmise that after thekilling
ofthefather atime followed when thebrothers
quarrelled among themselves forthesuccession,
which each ofthemwanted toobtain forhimself
alone. Theycame toseethat thesefights were
asdangerousastheywere futile. Thishard-won
understandingaswell asthememory ofthe
deed ofliberation theyhadachievedtogether
andtheattachment thathadgrown upamong
them duringthetime oftheir exile ledatlast
toaunionamong them, asortofsocial contract.
Thus therecame intobeingthe firstform ofa
socialorganization accompanied byarenunciation

Dbligations;institutions declared sacred, which

morality and law. Each renounced theideal
3fgainingforhimself thepositionoffather, of
possessinghismother orsister. With thisthe
taboo ofincest andthelawofexogamy came into
being.Agood partofthepower which had
become vacant throughthefather's deathpassed
tothewomen; thetime ofthematriarchate
followed. Thememoryofthefather lived on
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION133
duringthistime ofthe"brother horde." A
strong animal, which perhapsatfirstwas also
dreaded, wasfound asasubstitute. Such a
choice mayseem very strangetous,butthegulf
whichman created laterbetween himself andthe
animals didnotexist forprimitive man.Nordoes
itwith ourchildren, whose animalphobias we
havebeen able toexplainasdread ofthefather.
Therelationshiptothetotem animal retained
theoriginal ambivalency offeeling towards
thefather. Thetotem was,ontheonehand, the
corporealancestor andprotecting spirit ofthe
clan; hewas toberevered andprotected. On
theother hand, afestival wasinstituted onwhich

Thisgreatdaywasinrealityafeastoftriumphto

Where, inthisconnection, doesreligion come
in?Totemism, with itsworshipofafather substi-
tute, theambivalency towards thefather which
isevidenced bythetotemfeast, theinstitution
ofremembrance festivals andoflawsthebreaking

and itillustrates theclose connectionexisting
134 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
from theverybeginningoftimebetween social
institutions andmoralobligations. The further
developmentofreligion canbetreated hereonly
inaverysummaryfashion. Without adoubt it
proceeded paralleltotheculturaldevelopment
ofmankind andthechangesinthestructure of
human social institutions.
Thenextstepforward from totemism isthe
humanizingoftheworshipped being. Human
gods, whoseorigin from thetotem isnotveiled,
take theplace previouslyfilled byanimals.
Either thegodisstillrepresentedasananimal or
atleasthebears thecountenance ofananimal;
thetotem maybecome theinseparable com-
panionofthegod, or,again,themythmakes the

buthispredecessor. Atoneperioditishard to
saywhengreatmother-deitiesappeared, prob-
ablybefore the malegods, andtheywerewor-
shippedbeside thelatter foralongtime tocome.
Duringthattime agreatsocial revolution had
takenplace. Matriarchy was followed bya
restitution ofthepatriarchalorder. Thenew
fathers,itistrue, never succeeded totheomni-
potenceoftheprimaevalfather. There were too
manyofthem andtheylived inlarger com-
munities than theoriginal horde hadbeen; they
hadtogetonwithoneanother andwere restricted
bysocial institutions. Probably themother
deities weredeveloped when thematriarchy was
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION135
being limited, inorder tocompensatethe
dethroned mothers. Themale gods appearat
firstassonsbythesideofthegreat mothers; only
laterdothey clearly assume thefeatures ofthe
father. These male godsofpolytheism mirror the
conditions ofpatriarchaltimes. Theyarenumer-
ous, they have toshare theirauthority, and
occasionally theyobey ahigher god.Thenext
step,however, leads ustothetopicthat interests

deitywhose powerisunlimited.
Imust admit that thishistorical surveyleaves
manyagapand inmany pointsneeds further
confirmation. Yetwhoever declares ourrecon-
struction ofprimaeval historytobefantastic
greatlyunderestimates therichness andtheforce
oftheevidence thathasgonetomake upthis
reconstruction. Large portionsofthepast,which
areherewoven into awhole, arehistorically
provenorevenshow their traces tothisday,such
asmatriarchalright, totemism andmalecom-
munities. Others have survived inremarkable
replicas. Thusmore thanoneauthor hasbeen
struck bythecloseresemblance between therite
ofChristian Communion where thebeliever
symbolically incorporatestheblood and flesh of
hisGod and theTotem feast, whose inner
meaningitreproduces. Numerous survivals of

contribution towards anunderstanding ofthe
highly importantrelation between father and
son Ineed onlyquotetheanimalphobias, the
fearofbeingeaten bythefather (which seems so
strangetothegrown mind), andtheenormous
intensityofthecastration complex. There is
nothinginourreconstruction that isinvented,
nothingthat isnotbased ongood grounds.
Letussupposethatthepresentationheregiven
ofprimaeval historyisonthewhole credible.
Then twoelements canberecognizedinreligious
ritesand doctrines: ontheonehand, fixations
ontheoldfamily history and survivals ofthis;
ontheother hand, reproductionsofthepastand
areturn longafter ofwhathadbeenforgotten.
Itisthelatter element thathasuntilnowbeen
overlooked and therefore notunderstood. It
willtherefore beillustrated herebyatleastone
impressive example.
Itisspecially worthy ofnote thateverymemory
returning from theforgotten pastdoes sowith
great force, produces anincomparably strong
influence onthemass ofmankind andputs
forward anirresistible claim tobebelieved,
against which alllogical objections remain
powerless verymuch like the credoquia
absurdum. Thisstrangecharacteristic canonlybe
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION137
understood bycomparison with thedelusions ina
psychoticcase. Ithaslongbeenrecognized that
delusions contain apieceofforgotten truth,
which had atitsreturn toputupwithbeing
distorted andmisunderstood, andthatthecom-
pulsiveconviction appertainingtothedelusion
emanates from thiscoreoftruthandspreadsto
theerrors thatenshroud it.Such akernel of
truth whichwemiglitcall historical truth must
alsobeconceded tothedoctrines ofthevarious
religions. They are,itistrue,imbued with the
character ofpsychotic symptoms, but asmass
phenomena they have escapedthecurse of
isolation.

theism among theJewish people and itscontinua-

Itisthereligionoftheprimaevalfather andthe
hopeofreward, distinction andfinally world
sovereignty,isbound upwith it.Thelast-named

intheir belief intheconspiracyofthe"Elders

The restoration totheprimaevalfather ofhis

thiscould notbetheend.The otherpartsof

correctlytraced itback toitsprimaevalsource.

bewelcomed intheform ofagospelofsalvation
(Evangel). ASon ofGod, innocent himself,

Probablytraditions from Oriental andGreek

I4O MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
That theRedeemer sacrificed himself asan
innocent man wasanobviouslytendentious
distortion, difficult toreconcile withlogical
thinking. How could amanwhowasinnocent

wasnosuch contradiction. The"redeemer"
could benoone elsebuthewhowasmostguilty,

ofthe"
tragic guilt"ofthehero indrama a
guilt hard todemonstrate otherwise. Wecan
scarcely doubt thatinGreek tragedytheheroand
thechorusrepresentthissame rebel heroandthe
brother horde, and itcannot bewithoutsignifi-
cance that intheMiddle Agesthetheatre began
afresh with thestory ofthePassion.
Ihave already mentioned that theChristian
ceremonyofHolyCommunion, inwhich the
believerincorporatesthefleshandblood ofthe
Redeemer, repeatsthecontent oftheoldTotem
feast;itdoes so,itistrue, onlyinitstender and
adoring sense, notinitsaggressivesense. The
ambivalency dominating thefather -son relation-
ship, however, showsclearlyinthefinal result
ofthereligiousinnovation. Meant topropitiate
thefatherdeity,itendsbyhisbeing dethroned
and setaside. TheMosaicreligion hadbeen a
Fatherreligion; Christianity became aSon
religion. The oldGod, theFather, tooksecond
place; Christ, theSon, stood inHisstead, just
asinthose dark times everysonhadlongedtodo.
Paul, bydevelopingtheJewish religion further,
became itsdestroyer. Hissuccess wascertainly
mainly duetothefactthatthroughtheidea of
salvation helaidtheghostofthefeeling ofguilt.
Itwas alsodue tohisgiving uptheideaofthe
chosenpeopleand itsvisiblesign circum-
cision. That ishow thenewreligion could
become all-embracing,universal. Althoughthis
142 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
stepmight have been determined byPaul's
revengefulness onaccount oftheopposition
which hisinnovation found amongtheJews,
nevertheless one characteristic oftheoldAton
religion (universality) was reinstated; arestric-
tionhadbeen abolished which ithadacquired
whilepassing ontoanew carrier, theJewish
people.
Incertainrespectsthenewreligion was a
culturalregressionascomparedwith theolder
Jewish religion;thishappens regularly when a
newmass ofpeopleofalower cultural level
effects aninvasion orisadmitted intoanolder
culture. Christianreligiondidnotkeeptothe
lofty heights ofspiritualitytowhich theJewish
religion hadsoared. Theformer wasnolonger
strictly monotheistic, took overfrom thesur-
rounding peoples numeroussymbolical rites, re-
established thegreatMother Goddess andfound
room formanydeities ofpolytheisminaneasily
recognizable disguise thoughinsubordinate
positions. Above allitwasnotinaccessible as
theAtonreligion and thesubsequent Mosaic
religion hadbeen tothepenetrationofsuper-
stitions, magical andmysticalelements which
provedagreat hindrance tothespiritual develop-
ment oftwofollowingmillenia.
ThetriumphofChristianity wasarenewed

itymarked aprogressinthehistory ofreligion:
that istosay,inregardtothereturn ofthe

tospeak,afossil.
Itwould beworth while tounderstand why
themonotheistic ideashould make suchadeep
impression onjusttheJewish people, andwhy
they adhered toitsotenaciously.Ibelieve
thisquestion canbeanswered. Thegreat deed
andmisdeed ofprimaeval times, themurder ofthe
Father, wasbrought home totheJews,forfate
decreed thattheyshouldrepeatitontheperson
ofMoses, aneminent father substitute. Itwas
acaseofactinginstead ofremembering, some-
thing which often happens during analytic work
with neurotics. They respondedtothedoctrine
ofMoses which should havebeen astimulus to
theirmemory bydenyingtheir act, didnot
progress beyond therecognitionofthegreat
Father andbarred thepassagetothepointwhere
lateronPaul started hiscontinuation ofprimaeval
history.Itcanscarcelybechance thattheviolent
death ofanothergreatman should become the
starting pointforthecreation ofanewreligion
byPaul. Thiswasamanwhom asmallnumber
ofadherents inJudea believed tobetheSonof
Godandthepromised Messiah, andwho later
ontookoversome ofthechildhood historythat
hadbeen attached toMoses. Inreality, however,
144 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
wehave hardly more definite knowledge ofhim
thanwehave ofMoses. Wedonotknow ifhe
wasreallythegreatmanwhom theGospels
depictorwhether itwasnotrather the factand
thecircumstances ofhisdeath thatwere the

phantasyoftheMessiah, whowas toreturn and

firstMessiah, Christ became hissubstitute and

ThepoorJewish people, who with itsusual
stiff-necked obduracy continued todenythe
murder oftheir"father/5hasdearly expiated
thisinthecourse ofcenturies. Over andover
again theyheard thereproach: youkilled our
God. And thisreproachistrue,ifrightly
interpreted.Itsays,inreference tothehistory of
religion: youwon't admit that youmurdered
God(thearchetypeofGod, theprimaevalFather
and hisreincarnations). Something should be
added, namely:"Itistrue,wedidthesame
thing, butweadmittedit,andsince thenwehave
beenpurified."
Not allaccusations with which antisemitism
pursuesthedescendants oftheJewish peopleare
based onsuchgoodfoundations. There must, of
course, bemore thanonereason foraphenomenon
ofsuchintensity andlasting strengthasthe
popularhatred ofJews.Awhole series ofreasons
canbedivined: some ofthem, which needno
interpretation,arisefrom obvious considerations;
others liedeeper andspring from secret sources,
which onewould regardasthespecificmotives.
Inthe firstgroupthemost fallacious isthe
reproachoftheirbeing foreigners,since inmany
places nowadays under thesway ofantisemitism
theJews were theoldest constituents ofthe
K
146 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
populationorarrived even before thepresentin-
habitants. This isso,forexample,inthetown
ofCologne, where Jewscame with theRomans,
before itwascolonized byGermanic tribes. Other
groundsforantisemitism arestronger,asfor
example,thecircumstance thatJews mostlylive
asaminority among otherpeoples,since the
feeling ofsolidarity ofthemasses inorder tobe
completehasneed ofananimosity against an
outside minority andthenumerical weakness of
theminorityinvitessuppression. Two other
peculiaritiesthattheJews possess, however, are
quite unpardonable. The first isthat inmany
respects theyaredifferent from their"hosts."
Notfundamentally so,sincetheyarenotaforeign

HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION147
Thedeepermotives ofantisemitism have their
roots intimes long past; theycome from the
unconscious and Iamquite preparedtohear
thatwhat Iamgoingtosaywillatfirstappear
incredible. Iventure toassert thatthejealousy
which theJews evoked intheotherpeoples by
maintainingthattheywere thefirst-born, favour-
itechild ofGod theFather hasnotyetbeen
overcome bythose others, justasifthelatterhad
given credence totheassumption. Furthermore,
amongthecustoms through which theJews
marked offtheir aloofposition,thatofcircum-
cisionmade adisagreeable, uncanny impression
onothers. Theexplanation probablyisthat it
reminds them ofthedreaded castration ideaand
ofthingsintheirprimaeval pastwhichtheywould
fainforget. Then there islastly themost recent
motive oftheseries.Wemust notforgetthat all
thepeoples whonow excel inthepracticeofanti-
semitism became Christiansonlyinrelatively
recent times, sometimes forced toitbybloody
compulsion. Onemight say,theyallare"
badly
christened ";under thethinveneer ofChristian-
itytheyhaveremained what their ancestors were,
barbarically polytheistic. They have notyet
overcome their grudge againstthenewreligion
which wasforced onthem, andtheyhavepro-
jecteditontothesource fromwhichChristianity
came tothem. The facts thattheGospelstella
storywhich isenacted among Jews, andintruth
148 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
treats onlyofJews, hasfacilitated such aprojec-
tion.Thehatred forJudaismisatbottom hatred
forChristianity, and itisnotsurprisingthatinthe
German National-Socialist revolution this close
connection ofthetwomonotheisticreligionsfinds
such clearexpressioninthehostile treatment of
both.

Inthis translation from individual intomass
psychology two difficulties emerge,different in
nature andimportance,which wemustnow
examine. The first isthatwehave treated hereof
onlyonecase intherichphenomenologyofthe

others. Theauthorregretfullyhastoadmit that

nottheexpert knowledge necessarytocomplete
theinvestigation. This limited knowledgewill
allowhimperhapstoaddthatthefoundingofthe
Mohammedanreligion seems tohim tobean
abbreviatedrepetition oftheJewish one, in
imitation ofwhich itmade itsappearance. There
isreason tobelieve that theProphet originally
intended toaccepttheJewish religioninfullfor

himself and hispeople. Theregainingoftheone
great primaevalFatherproducedintheArabs an
extraordinary advance inself-confidence which
ledthem togreat worldly successes, butwhich
itistrue exhausted itself inthese. Allah proved
himself tobemuch moregratefultohischosen
peoplethanJahve had inhistime. Theinner
developmentofthenewreligion, however, soon
came toastandstill, perhapsbecause itlacked
theprofundity which intheJewish religion
resulted from themurder ofitsfounder. The
apparentlyrationalisticreligions oftheEast are
inessence ancestor cults; therefore they stop

itpresentsanewproblemofacardinal nature.
The questionarises inwhat form istheactive
tradition inthe lifeofthepeoplesstill extant.
There isnosuchquestion with individuals, for
here thematter issettled bytheexistence of
memorytraces ofthepastintheunconscious.
Letusgoback toourhistoricalexample. The
compromiseinQades, wesaid,wasbased onthe
continued existence ofapowerfultradition
living oninthepeople whohadreturned from
Egypt.There isnoproblemhere.Wesuggested
thatsuchatradition wasmaintained byconscious
memoryoforalcommunications which hadbeen
passedonfrom forbears ofonlytwoorthree
generations ago.The latterhadbeenparticipants
andeye-witnesses oftheevents inquestion. Can
webelieve thesame, however, forthe later
centuries, namely,thatthetradition wasalways
based onaknowledge, communicated inanormal
way,which hadbeen transmitted from forbear
todescendant ?Who thepersons were that
stored suchknowledge andpasseditonfrom
mouth tomouth wenolonger know, aswedid
inthe earlier case. AccordingtoSellin, the
tradition ofthemurder ofMoses wasalways
present amongthePriests, until atlast itwas set
down inwriting which alonemade itpossible
forSellin todivine it.Yet itcould nothavebeen
known tomany;itwasnotgeneral knowledge.
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION151
And isthisformoftransmission enoughtoexplain
itseffect ?Canwecredit such aknowledge on

imaginationofthemasses solastingly when they
learn ofit?Itrather looks asifthere were a
somethingalsointheignorant mass ofthepeople
akin tothisknowledge onthepartofthefew,
which comes forward tomeet itassoon asitis

Itbecomes harder stilltoarrive ataconclusion
whenweturn totheanalogouscase inprimaeval
times. Inthecourse ofthousands ofcenturies
itcertainly becameforgottenthat there wasa
primaevalfatherpossessingthequalities wemen-
tioned, andwhat fatehemet.Norcanweassume
anoraltradition aswedidwith Moses. Inwhat
sense, therefore, canthere beanyquestion ofa
tradition ?Inwhat form could ithave existed ?
Tohelpreaders who areunwillingorun-
preparedtoplungeintocomplicated psycho-
logicalmatters Ishallplacetheresult ofthe
following investigationatthevery beginning.I
hold thattheconcordance between theindividual
andthemass isinthispointalmostcomplete.
Themasses, too,retain animpressionofthepast
inunconscious memorytraces.
The case oftheindividual seems tobeclear
enough. Thememorytrace ofearlyevents he
hasretained, buthehasretained itinaspecial
psychologicalcondition. Onecansaythat the
152MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
individual always knew ofthem, inthesense that
we knowrepressedmaterial. Wehave formed
certainconceptions andthey caneasily be
proved byanalysisofhowsomething gets
forgotten andofhow after atime itcancome to
light again. Theforgotten material isnotex-
tinguished, only"
repressed"
;itstraces are
extant inthememoryintheiroriginal freshness,
buttheyareisolated by"counter-cathexes."
They cannot establish contact with theother
intellectualprocesses; they areunconscious,
inaccessible toconsciousness. Itmayhappen
that certainpartsoftherepressedmaterial have
escapedthisprocess, have remained accessible
tomemory andoccasionally reappearincon-
sciousness, buteven thentheyareisolated, a
foreign body without anyconnection with the
restofthemind. Thismayhappen, but itneed
nothappen. Repression mayalsobecomplete,
and this isthecaseweproposetoexamine.
Thisrepressedmaterial retains itsimpetusto
penetrateinto consciousness. Itreaches itsaim
when three conditions arepresent. (i)When the
strengthofcounter-cathexis isdiminished byan
illness which actsontheEgo itself, orthrougha
different distribution ofcathexis intheEgoas
happens regularly during sleep. (2)When those
instincts attached totherepressedmaterial become
strengthened. Theprocesses during puberty pro-
vide thebestexamplefor this.(3)Whenever
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION153
recent events produce impressionsorexperi-
ences which are somuch like therepressed
material thattheyhave thepowertoawaken it.
Thus therecent materialgetsstrengthened bythe
latent energyoftherepressed, andtherepressed
material producesitseffect behind therecent
material andwith itshelp.
Innone ofthethree cases does thematerial
thathadbeen repressedsucceed inreaching
consciousness unimpededorwithoutchange.It
mustalways undergodistortions which bearwitness
tothenotentirely overcome resistance derived
from thecounter-cathexis, orelsetothemodify-
inginfluence of arecentexperienceortoboth.
Asadistinguishing signandlandmark wehave
used thedifference between apsychic process
beingconscious orunconscious. Therepressed
material isunconscious. Itwould beacheering
simplificationifthissentence could bereversed,
i.e.ifthedifference ofthequalities"conscious"
and"unconscious"were identical with the
difference: belongingtotheEgoorrepressed.
The fact thatourmental lifeharboured such
isolated andunconscious material would benew
andimportant enough.Inreality thingsare
more complex.Itistrue that allrepressed
material isunconscious, butnottrue thatevery-
thing belongingtotheEgoisconscious. We
become aware that beingconscious isan
ephemeral quality which adheres toapsychical
154MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
process only temporarily.This iswhyforour
purposes wemustreplace"conscious" by"capable
ofbeing conscious," andwecallthisquality"
pre-
conscious." Wethensaymorecorrectly:theEgo
isessentially preconscious (virtually conscious) ,
butpartsoftheEgoareunconscious.
This laststatement teaches usthatthequalities
towhich wehave attended sofardonotsuffice
toshow usthewayinthedarkness ofmental life.
Wemust introduce another distinction, oneno
longer qualitative,buttopographical, and
which lends itaspecialvaluegeneticatthesame
time.Nowwedistinguish from ourmental life
which weseetobeanapparatus consistingof
several hierarchies, districts orprovinces one

Egocorresponds,aswehavementioned, with the
realm ofthepreconscious; partsofitnormally
remain unconscious. Thepsychical processesin
the"Id"obey quitedifferent laws; their course
andtheinfluencetheyexertononeanother are
different from those thatreignintheEgo.Itis
thediscovery ofthese differences thathasguided
ustoournewunderstanding andlends confirma-
tion toit.
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION155
The repressedmaterial must beregardedas
belongingtotheIdandobeysitsmechanisms;
itdiffers from itonlyinrespectofitsgenesis.
This differentiation takesplace duringtheearly
period,while theEgoisdevelopingoutoftheId.
Then theEgotakespossessionofpartoftheId
and raises itontothepreconscious level; other
partsarethusnotaffected andremain intheId
asthe"unconscious"

velopmentoftheEgo,however, certainpsychical
impressionsandprocessesinitgetshutoutby
defensive mechanisms; theyaredeprivedoftheir
preconscious character, sothattheyaredegraded
againtobecomeintegral partsoftheId.This,
therefore,isthe"
repressedmaterial"intheId.
Asregardsthepassage between thetwomental
provinces weassume, ontheonehand, that
unconscious processesintheIdcanberaised to
apreconsciouslevelandincorporatedinto the
Ego, and,ontheother hand, thatpreconscious
material intheEgocantravel theopposite way
andbeshifted back intotheId.That lateron
another district, the"
Super-ego,"isdelimited
intheEgo, doesnotconcern usinthiscontext.
Allthismayseem farfromsimple,but ifone
hasbecome familiar with theunaccustomed
topographical conceptionofthementalapparatus
then there arenoparticulardifficulties. Iwill
addhere that thetopographyofthepsycheI
have heredevelopedhasingeneral nothingtodo

with cerebral anatomy; there isonlyonepoint
where itimpinges on it.Theunsatisfactoriness of
thisconception which Iperceiveasclearlyas
anyonehas itsroots inourcomplete ignorance
ofthedynamic nature ofmentalprocesses. We
realise thatwhatdistinguishesaconscious idea
from apreconscious one,and thisfromanun-
conscious one,cannot beanythingelsebuta
modification, orperhapsalsoanother distribution,
ofpsychic energy. Wespeakofcathexes and
hypercathexes,butbeyondthiswelack all

consciousness weareatleast able tosaythat it
cleavesoriginallytoperception.Allperceptions
which come about through painful, tactile,
auditoryorvisual stimuli arethemorelikelyto
beconscious. Thought processes, andwhatmay
beanalogoustothem intheId,areunconscious
per se,andobtain theirentryintoconsciousness
bytheir connection, viathefunction ofspeech,
withmemorytraces ofperceptions through touch
and ear.Intheanimal, which lacksspeech,these
relationships must besimpler.
Theimpressionsoftheearly traumata, from
which westarted, areeither nottranslated into
thepreconsciousortheyaresoon re-directed
into theIdthrough repression.Their memory-
residues arethen unconscious andoperate from
the Id.Wecan believe wecan follow their
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION157
further fatedistinctlyaslongastheydealwith
personal experiences. Anewcomplication arises,
however, when webecome aware that there
probablyexists inthemental lifeoftheindividual
notonlywhat hehasexperienced himself, but
alsowhathebrought withhimatbirth, fragments
ofphylogenetic origin, anarchaicheritage. Then
thequestionarises :inwhat does thisinheritance
consist, what does itcontain, andwhat evidence
ofitisthere ?
The firstandmost certain answer isthat it
consists incertaindispositions, such asallliving
beings possess:that istosay,intheability and
tendencytofollow acertain direction ofdevelop-
ment, and toreact inaparticular waytocertain
excitations, impressions and stimuli. Since
experienceshows that individuals differ inthis
respect,ourarchaic inheritance includes these
differences; they represent what isrecognized
astheconstitutional element intheindividual.
Since allhumanbeings gothroughthesame
experiences,atleast intheir earliestyears, they
alsoreact tothem inthesameway,and this iswhy
thedoubt arose whether these reactions with all
theirindividual differences should notbereckoned
aspartofthatarchaicheritage.Thisdoubt must
berejected;thefactofthissimilaritydoes not
enrich ourknowledgeofthearchaicheritage.
Meanwhileanalyticresearch hasyieldedseveral
results whichgiveusfood forthought.First of
158MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
allthere istheuniversalityofspeech symbolism.
Symbolicsubstitution ofoneobject through
another thesame appliestoactions our
children areconversant with,and itseemsquite
natural tothem.Wecannot trace thewayin
which theylearned itandmust admit that in
manycases tolearn itwould beimpossible.It
isoriginal knowledge, which theadult lateron
forgets. Heemploys,itistrue, thesamesymbol-
isminhisdreams, buthedoesnotunderstand
them unless theanalyst interprets them forhim
andeventhenheisloath tobelieve thetranslation.
When hehasusedoneofthecommonphrases of
speechinwhich thissymbolismiscrystallized, he
has toadmit that itstruemeaning hadquite
escapedhim. Symbolismeven ignoresthediffer-
ence inlanguages; investigation would probably
show that itisubiquitous,thesame with all
peoples.Here there seems tobeanassured case
ofarchaic inheritance from thetimewhen
speech wasdeveloping, although onemight
attempt another explanation:onemight say
thatthese arethought-connectionsbetween ideas
which wereformed duringthehistoricaldevelop-
ment ofspeech andwhich have toberepeated
every time theindividualpasses through such a
development.This thenwould beacase of
inheriting athought-dispositionaselsewhere one
inherits aninstinctualdisposition;soitagain
would contribute nothing new toourproblem.
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION159
Analytic research, however, hasalsobrought
tolightotherthings, which exceed insignificance
anything wehave sofardiscussed. Instudying
reactions toearly traumata weoften find toour
surprisethattheydonotkeep strictlytowhat the
individual himself hasexperienced,butdeviate
from thisinawaythatwould accord much better
with their beingreactions togeneticevents and
ingeneral canbeexplained only throughthe
influence ofsuch. Thebehaviour ofaneurotic
child tohisparentswhen under theinfluence of
an(Edipus andcastration complexisveryrich
insuch reactions which seemunreasonable inthe
individual andcanonlybeunderstood phylo-
genetically,inrelation totheexperiencesof
earlier generations.Itwould beamplyworth
while tocollect andpublishthematerial onwhich
myremarks arebased. Infact itseems tome
convincing enoughtoallowme toventure
further and assert that thearchaic heritageof
mankind includes notonly dispositions,but
also ideational contents, memory-tracesofthe
experiencesofformer generations.Inthisway
theextent aswell asthesignificanceofthe
archaic heritage would beenhanced inaremark-
able degree.
Onsecond thoughtsImustadmit that Ihave
arguedasiftherewerenoquestionthatthere exists
aninheritance ofmemory-tracesofwhat our
forefathers experienced, quite independentlyof
l6o MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
direct communication andoftheinfluence of
education byexample. When Ispeakofanold
tradition stillalive inapeople,oftheformation
ofanational character,it issuchaninherited
tradition andnotonecarried onbyword of
mouth that Ihave inmind. Oratleast Idid
notdistinguish between thetwo,andwasnot
quiteclear about what aboldstepItookby
neglectingthisdifference. This state ofaffairs is
made more difficult,itistrue,bythepresent
attitude ofbiologicalscience whichrejectsthe
idea ofacquired qualities being transmitted to
descendants. Iadmit, inallmodesty,that in
spiteofthis Icannotpicture biological develop-
ment proceeding withouttakingthisfactor into
account. Thetwo cases,itistrue, arenotquite
similar; with theformer itisaquestionof
acquired qualitiesthat arehard toconceive,
with the latter memory-traces ofexternal ex-
pressions, something almost concrete. Probably,
however, wecannot anfondimagine onewithout
theother. Ifweacceptthecontinued existence
ofsuchmemory-tracesinourarchaic inheritance
thenwehave bridgedthegapbetween individual
andmasspsychology, andcan treatpeoplesas
wedotheindividual neurotic. Though wemay
admit that forthememory-tracesinourarchaic
inheritance wehave sofarnostronger proof
than those remnants ofmemory evoked by
analytic work, which call foraderivation from
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION l6l
phylogenesis, yetthisproofseems tomeconvinc-
ingenoughtopostulatesuchastate ofaffairs. If
thingsaredifferent thenweareunable toadvance
onestepfurther onourway,either inpsycho-
analysisorinmasspsychology.Itisbold, but
inevitable.
Inmakingthispostulate wealsodosomething
else.Wediminish theover-wide gaphuman
arroganceinformer times created between man
and beast. Iftheso-called instincts ofanimals
which from thevery beginningallow them to
behave intheirnewconditions oflivingasifthey
were oldand long-establishedones ifthis
instinctual lifeofanimalspermitsofanyexplana-
tion atall,itcanonlybethis: thatthey carry
over into theirnew existence theexperienceof
their kind, that istosay,thattheyhavepreserved
intheirminds memories ofwhat their ancestors
experienced.Inthehuman animal things should
notbefundamentallydifferent. Hisownarchaic
heritage thoughdifferent inextent andcharac-
tercorrespondstotheinstincts ofanimals.
After these considerations Ihavenoqualmsin
sayingthatmenhave always known inthis
particular waythatonceuponatimetheyhad
aprimaevalfather andkilled him.
Two further questions must herebeanswered.
Firstunder what conditions doessuchamemory
enter intothearchaic inheritance and, secondly,
inwhat circumstances can itbecome active, that
162 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
istosay,penetratefrom itsunconscious state in
theIdintoconsciousness thoughinanaltered
and distorted form ?Theanswer tothe first
questioniseasytoformulate: ithappens when
theexperienceisimportant enoughorisrepeated
oftenenoughorinboth cases. With thefather-
murder both conditions are fulfilled. Tothe
secondquestionIwould remark: theremaybe
anumber ofinfluences which need not allbe
known; aspontaneouscourse isalsopossiblein
analogywithwhathappensinsome neuroses.
Theawakening, however, ofthememory-trace
through arecent realrepetition oftheevent is
certainlyofdecisiveimportance. Themurder of
Moses wassuch arepetition, and lateronthe
supposed judicial murder ofChrist, sothatthese
events move into theforeground ascausative
agents.Itseems asifthegenesis ofmonotheism
would nothave beenpossible without these
events. Wearereminded ofthewords ofthe
poet:
"Allthat istoliveinendless song
Must inlife-time firstbedrown'd."l
Iwillconclude with aremark which furnishes
apsychological argument. Atradition based only
onoralcommunication could notproducethe

oratleastverymuch inthatway.

Thefollowing partofthisessay cannot be sent

andapologies.For itisnoother than afaithful,
often literal, repetitionofthe firstpartsave that
some ofthe criticalinvestigations have been

Iknow that thiswayofpresenting mysubjectis

approveofitwholeheartedly. Why have Inot
avoided it?Theanswer tothisquestioniseasy
formetofind,butrather hard toadmit. Ihave
notbeen able toefface thetraces oftheunusual
wayinwhich thisbookcame tobewritten.
Intruth ithasbeen written twice over. The
firsttimewasafewyears agoinVienna, where
Ididnotbelieve inthepossibilityofpublishing
it.Idecided toputitaway, but ithaunted me
likeanunlaidghost, and Icompromised by
publishingtwopartsofthebookindependently
intheperiodical Imago. They were thepsycho-
analytical starting pointsofthewhole book:
"Moses anEgyptian"andthehistoricalessay
built on it"IfMoses wasanEgyptian."The
rest,which might giveoffence andwasdanger-
ousnamely, theapplicationofmytheorytothe
genesisofmonotheism andmyinterpretationof
religionIkept back, asIthought,forever.
Then inMarch 1938came theunexpected
German invasion. Itforcedmetoleavemyhome,
but italsofreedmeofthefear lestmypublishing

and soIstarted torewrite thethirdpartofmy

naturallynecessitated aregroupingofthe

editing, however, Ididnotsucceed infittingthe
whole material in.Ontheother hand, Icould
notmake upmymind torelinquish thetwo
former contributionsaltogether, and this ishow
thecompromise came about ofadding unaltered
awholepieceofthe firstversion tothesecond, a
device which hasthedisadvantage ofextensive

Imight,itistrue, findcomfort inthereflection
that thematter Itreated ofwas sonewand

2.ThePeople ofIsrael
Ifwearequiteclear inourminds thatapro-
cedure likethepresentone totakefrom the
traditional material what seems useful and to
reject what isunsuitable, andthen toputthe
individualpieces together accordingtotheir
psychological probabilitydoes notafford any
securityforfindingthetruth, thenone isquite
righttoaskwhysuchanattempt wasunder-
taken. Inanswer tothis Imust citetheresult.
Ifwesubstantially reduce thesevere demands
usually made onanhistorical andpsychological
investigationthen itmightbepossibletoclear
upproblemsthathave always seemed worthy
ofattention and which,inconsequenceof
recent events, force themselves again onour
observation. Weknow that ofallthepeoples
who lived inantiquityinthebasin oftheMedi-
terranean theJewish peopleisperhapstheonly
onethat still exists inname andprobablyalso
innature. With anunexampled powerof
resistance ithasdefied misfortune and ill-treat-
ment, developed specialcharacter traits and,
incidentally, earned theheartydislike ofall
otherpeoples. Whence comes thisresistance ofthe
Jew,andhow hischaracter isconnected with his
fate, arethings onewould like tounderstand
better.
Wemaystartfrom onecharacter trait ofthe
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 167
Jews which governstheirrelationshiptoother
people.There isnodoubt thattheyhave avery
good opinionofthemselves, think themselves
nobler, onahigher level, superiortotheothers
fromwhom theyarealsoseparated bymany of
their customs.1With thistheyareanimated by
aspecialtrust inlife,such asisbestowed bythe
secretpossessionofaprecious gift ;itisakindof
optimism. Religious people would call ittrust in
God.
Weknow thereason ofthisattitude oftheirs
andwhat theirprecioustreasure is.They really
believe themselves tobeGod's chosenpeople;
theyholdthemselves tobespecially near toHim,
and this iswhatmakes themproud andconfident.
Accordingtotrustworthy accounts theybehaved
inHellenistic times astheydoto-day. The
Jewish character, therefore, even thenwaswhat
itisnow, and theGreeks, among whom and
alongside whom they lived, reacted totheJewish
qualitiesinthesamewayastheir"hosts"do
to-day. They reacted, soonemight think, asif
theytoobelieved inthepreference which the
Israelites claimed forthemselves. When one is
thedeclared favourite ofthedreaded father one
neednotbesurprisedthattheother brothers and
sisters arejealous. What thisjealousy canlead to
1The insult frequently hurled atthem inancient times thatthey
were lepers (cf.Manetho) must beread asaprojection:"They
keep apart from usasifwewere lepers."
168 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
isexquisitely shown intheJewish legendof
Joseph and hisbrethren. Thesubsequentcourse
ofworldhistory seemed tojustifythisJewish
arrogance,forwhen lateronGodconsented to
sendmankind aMessiah andRedeemer Heagain
choseHimfromamong theJewish people. The
otherpeoples would then havehadreason to
say:"Indeed, theywereright; theyareGod's
chosenpeople."Instead ofwhich ithappened
that thesalvation through JesusChrist brought
ontheJews nothing butastronger hatred, while
theJews themselves derived noadvantage from
thissecondproofofbeing favoured, becausethey
didnotrecognizetheRedeemer.
Onthestrengthofourpreviousremarks we
maysaythat itwasthemanMoseswhostamped
theJewish peoplewith thistrait, onewhich
became sosignificanttothem foralltime.He
enhanced their self-confidence byassuring them
that theywere thechosenpeopleofGod; he
declared them tobeholy,andlaidonthem the
dutytokeep apart from others. Not that the
otherpeoplesontheirpartlacked self-confidence.
Then, justasnow, each nation thoughtitself
superiortoalltheothers. The self-confidence of
theJews, however, became through Moses
anchored inreligion ;itbecame apartoftheir
religiousbelief. Bytheparticularlyclose rela-
tionshiptotheirGodtheyacquiredapartofHis
grandeur. And sinceweknow thatbehind the
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION169
Godwhochose theJewsanddelivered themfrom
Egyptstood themanMoses whoachieved that
deed, ostensiblyatGod's command, weventure
tosaythis: itwasoneman, theman Moses,
whocreated theJews. Tohim thispeople owes
itstenacityinsupporting life; tohim,however,
alsomuch ofthehostility which ithasmet and is
meetingstill.
3.TheGreatMan
How isitpossiblethatonesingleman can
developsuch extraordinary effectiveness, thathe
cancreate outofindifferent individuals and
families onepeople, canstampthispeoplewith
itsdefinite character anddetermine itsfate for
millenia tocome ?Isnotsuchanassumptiona
retrogressiontothemanner ofthinkingthat
producedcreation myths andheroworship,to
times inwhich historicalwriting exhausted itself
innarratingthedates and lifehistories ofcer-
tainindividualssovereignsorconquerors?The
inclination ofmodern times tends rather totrace
back theevents ofhumanhistorytomore hidden,
general andimpersonalfactors the forcible
influence ofeconomic circumstances, changesin
foodsupply, progressintheuseofmaterials and

andchangeofclimate. Inthese factors individuals
playnootherpartthan that ofexponentsor
170 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
representativesofmass tendencies which must
come toexpression andwhich found that
expressionasitwerebychance insuchpersons.
These arequite legitimate pointsofview, but
they remind usofasignificant discrepancy
between thenature ofourthinking apparatus
andtheorganizationoftheworld which weare
tryingtoapprehend. Ourimperative need for
cause and effect issatisfied when eachprocess
hasonedemonstrable cause. Inreality, outside
usthis ishardly so;each event seems tobeover-
determined and turns out tobethe effect of
several convergingcauses. Intimidated bythe
countlesscomplicationsofevents research takes
thepartofonechain ofeventsagainst another,
stipulatescontrasts thatdonot existandwhich
arecreated merely through tearing apart more
comprehensiverelations.1
If,therefore, theinvestigationofoneparticular
casedemonstrates theoutstanding influence ofa

factors. Inpointoffactthere iswithout doubt
room forboth. Inthegenesisofmonotheism we
cannot,itistrue, pointtoanyother external
factor than thosewehave already mentioned,
namely,that thisdevelopmenthastodowith the
establishing ofcloser connections amongdiffer-
entnations andtheexistence ofagreat empire.Wewillkeep, therefore, aplacefor"thegreat
man"inthechain, orrather inthenetwork, of
determiningcauses. Itmaynotbequite useless,
however, toaskunder what condition webestow
this titleofhonour. Wemaybesurprisedtofind
that itisnotsoeasytoanswer thisquestion. A
firstformulation, which would define asgreata
human being specially endowed withqualities
wevalue highly,isobviouslyinallrespects
unsuitable. Beauty,forinstance, andmuscular
strength much astheymaybeenvied donot
establish aclaim to"
greatness.55There should
perhapsbementalqualities present, psychical
andintellectual distinction. Inthelatterrespect
wehavemisgivings: amanwho hasanout-

When, ontheonehand, thefigure ofthegreat
man hasgrownintoadivine one,it istime to
remember, ontheother hand, that thefather
alsowasonce achild. Thegreat religiousidea
forwhich themanMoses stood was, aswehave
stated, nothisown; hehadtaken itoverfrom
hisKing Ikhnaton. And the latter whose
greatnessasafounder ofreligionisprovedwith-
outadoubt followedperhapsintimations which
throughhismother orbyotherwayshadreached
himfrom thenear orthefarEast.
Wecannot trace thenetwork anyfurther. If
thepresent argument, however,iscorrect sofar,
the idea ofmonotheism must have returned in
thefashion ofaboomerangintothecountry of
itsorigin.Itappearsfruitless toattemptto
ascertain what merit attaches toanindividual in
anew idea.Obviously many have takenpartin
itsdevelopment andmade contributions toit.
Ontheother hand,itwould bewrongtobreak
offthechain ofcausation withMoses and to
neglect what hissuccessors, theJewish prophets,
achieved. Monotheism had nottaken root in
Egypt. Thesame failure might havehappened
inIsrael after thepeople hadthrown offthe
inconvenient andpretentious religion imposed
onthem. From themass oftheJewish people,
however, there aroseagain andagainmenwho
lentnewcolour tothefading tradition, renewed
theadmonishments anddemands ofMoses and
176MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
didnotrestuntil thelostcause wasoncemore
regained.Intheconstant endeavour ofcenturies,
and lastbutnotleastthrough twogreat reforms

exile there tookplacethechange ofthepopular

hadforced upontheJews.And itistheproofof

become theJewish peoplethat itcouldbring
forth somany persons whowere readytotake
uponthemselves theburden oftheMosaic
religionforthereward ofbelievingthat their
people wasa chosen oneandperhapsforother
benefits ofasimilar order.
4.TheProgressinSpirituality
Toachievelasting psychicaleffects inapeopleit
isobviously notsufficient toassure them thatthey
werespeciallychosen byGod. This assurance
must beprovediftheyaretoattach belief toit
anddraw their conclusions from that belief. In
thereligionofMoses theexodus served assuch
aproof; God, orMoses inhisname, didnottire
ofcitingthisproofoffavour. The feast ofthe
Passover was established tokeepthisevent in
mind, orrather anoldfeastwasendowed with
thismemory. Yet itwasonlyamemory. The
exodus itself belongedtoadimpast. Atthe
time thesignsofGod's favour were meagre
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION177
enough;thefateofthepeopleofIsrael would
rather indicate hisdisfavour. Primitivepeoples
used todeposeorevenpunishtheir godsifthey
didnot fulfil theirdutyofgranting themvictory,
fortune and comfort. Kings have often been
treatedsimilarlytogodsinevery age ;theancient
identity ofkingand god,i.e. theircommon
origin, thusbecomes manifest. Modernpeoples
alsoareinthehabit ofthusgettingridoftheir
kingsifthesplendour oftheir reignisdulled by
defeats accompanied bythe lossoflandand
money. WhythepeopleofIsrael, however,
adhered totheirGod allthemoredevotedly the
worse they were treated byHim that isa
question which wemust leave openforthe
moment.
Itmaystimulate ustoenquire whether the
religion ofMoses hadgiven thepeople nothing
elsebutanincrease inself-confidence throughthe
consciousness ofbeing"chosen." The next
element isindeedeasilyfound. Theirreligion
alsogavetotheJewsamuch more grandiose
ideaoftheirGodortoexpressitmoresoberly
theideaofamore august God.Whoever believed
inthisGodtookpartinhisgreatness,sotospeak,
mightfeelupliftedhimself. Thismay notbe
quiteobvious tounbelievers, but itmay be
illustrated bythesimile ofthehighconfidence a
Briton would feelinaforeign land,made unsafe

TheprideinthegreatnessoftheBritish Empire

ofthegreater security andprotectionthat a
Britishsubject enjoys. Thesamemaybetrueof
theideaofthegreatGodand since onewould
hardly presumetoassistGod inhisconduct of
theworldprideinthegreatnessofGod goes
togetherwith thatofbeing"chosen.55
AmongthepreceptsofMosaicreligionisone
thathasmoresignificance than isatfirstobvious.
Itistheprohibition against making animage of
God,which means thecompulsiontoworship an
invisible God. Isurmise thatinthispoint Moses
hadsurpassedtheAtonreligioninstrictness.
Perhaps hemeant tobeconsistent; hisGodwas
tohave neither aname noracountenance. The
prohibition wasperhapsafreshprecaution
against magic malpractices.Ifthisprohibition
wasaccepted, however,itwasbound toexercise
aprofoundinfluence. For itsignified sub-
ordinatingsenseperceptiontoanabstract idea;
itwasatriumphofspiritualityover thesenses;
morepreciselyan instinctual renunciation1

accompanied byitspsychologically necessary
consequences.
Tomake more credible what atfirstglance
doesnotappear convincing wemust calltomind
otherprocessesofsimilar character inthedevelop-
ment ofhuman culture. The earliest among them

necessarytoconclude that ithappened.Inour
children, inadult neurotics aswell asinprimitive
people, wefind themental phenomenon which
wehave called thebelief inthe"
omnipotenceof

outer world bychangingit.Allmagic,the
predecessorofscience,isbasically founded on
thesepremisses.Allmagicofwordsbelongs here,
asdoes theconviction ofthepower connected

omnipotenceof

kindtook inthedevelopmentoflanguage, which
hadbroughtinitstrain suchanextraordinary
increase inthe intellectual faculties. There

psychical activity which concerned itselfwith the

wascertainly oneofthemostimportant stages on
thewaytobecoming human.
Anotherprocessoflater time confronts usina
much moretangibleform. Under theinfluence
ofexternal conditions whichweneed notfollow
uphereandwhich inpartarealsonotsufficiently

ture ofsociety wasreplaced byapatriarchal
one. Thisnaturally broughtwith itarevolution
intheexistingstate ofthelaw.Anecho ofthis
revolution can stillbeheard, Ithink, inthe
Oresteia of^Eschylos. Thisturning from the
mother tothefather, however, signifies above all
avictory ofspirituality over thesenses, that isto
sayastepforward inculture, since maternityis
proved bythesenses whereaspaternityisa
surmise based onadeduction andapremiss.This
declaration infavour ofthethought process,there-
byraisingitabove senseperception,wasproved
tobeastepcharged with serious consequences.
Some time between thetwo cases Ihave
mentioned another event tookplacewhich shows
acloserrelationshiptotheoneswehave investi-
gatedinthehistoryofreligion. Manfound that
hewasfaced with theacceptanceof"
spiritual"
forces, that istosaysuch forces ascannot be
apprehended bythesenses, particularly notby

wasthemovement oftheairthatprovided the
image ofspirituality,since thespirit borrows its
name from thebreath ofwind(animus, spiritus,
Hebrew: ruach= smoke). Theideaofthesoul
wasthusborn asthespiritual principleinthe

covered inhimself. Thewhole world became
animated, andscience, comingsomuchlater,had

ThroughtheMosaicprohibition Godwasraised
toahigherlevel ofspirituality;thedoorwas
openedtofurther changesintheideaofGodof
whichweshallspeaklater. Atpresent another of
itseffects willoccupyus.Allsuchprogressin
spiritualityresults inincreasing self-confidence,
inmaking people proudsothattheyfeelsuperior
tothosewhohaveremained inthebondage ofthe
senses.Weknow thatMoses hadgiventheJews
theproud feelingofbeing God's chosenpeople;
byde-materialising God anew, valuable con-
tribution wasmade tothesecret treasure ofthe
people. TheJews preservedtheir inclination
towardsspiritualinterests. Thepoliticalmis-
fortune ofthenation taught them toappreciate
182 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
theonly possession theyhad retained, their
written records, atitstrue value. Immediately
after thedestruction oftheTempleinJerusalem
byTitus, Rabbi Jochanaan benSakkai asked for
permissiontoopenatJabne the firstschool for
thestudy oftheTorah. Fromnowonitwasthe
Holy Book, andthestudy ofit,thatkeptthe
scatteredpeople together.
Somuch isgenerally known andaccepted.I
onlywished toadd that thiswhole develop-
ment, socharacteristic oftheJews, hadbeen
initiated byMoses'prohibition against worship-
pingGod inavisible form.
Thepreference which through twothousand
yearstheJewshave giventospiritual endeavour
has,ofcourse, had itseffect;ithashelpedto
build adyke against brutality andtheinclination
toviolence which areusually found where
athletic development becomes theideal ofthe
people. Theharmonious developmentofspiritual
andbodily activityasachieved bytheGreeks
wasdenied totheJews. Inthisconflict their
decision was atleastmade infavour ofwhat is
culturallythemoreimportant.
5.Renunciation versusGratification1
Itisnotatallobvious whyprogressinspiritual-

theself-confidence ofapersonaswell asofa
nation. This seems topresupposeadefinite
standard ofvalue andanotherpersonorinstitu-
tionwho uses it.Foranexplanation weturn to
ananalogouscase inthepsychology ofthe
individual whichwehave learned tounderstand.
When theIdmakes aninstinctual demand of
anerotic oraggressivenature onahumanbeing,
themostsimpleandnaturalresponsefortheEgo,
which governstheapparatusforthinking and
muscle innervation,istosatisfythisbyanaction.
This satisfaction oftheinstinct isfeltaspleasure
bytheEgo, justasnotsatisfyingthis instinct
would undoubtedly become asource ofdiscom-
fort.Now itmayhappenthat theEgoeschews
satisfaction oftheinstinct because ofexternal
obstacles, namely, when itrealizes thattheaction
inquestionwould bringinitscourse serious
dangertotheEgo. Such arefraining from satis-
faction, an"instinctual renunciation"because of
external obstacles aswesay,inobedience to
thereality-principleisneverpleasurable. The
instinctual renunciation wouldbring about a
lasting painfultension ifwedidnotsucceed in
diminishingthestrengthoftheinstinctual urge
itself throughadisplacementofenergy. This
instinctual renunciation mayalsobeforced on
us,however, byother motives, which werightly
callinner ones. Inthecourse ofindividual
developmentapartoftheinhibitingforces inthe
184MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
outer world becomes internalized; astandard
iscreated intheEgowhichopposestheother
faculties byobservation, criticism andprohibition.
Wecallthisnewstandard thesuper -ego.Fromnow
ontheEgo,before undertakingtosatisfy the
instincts, hastoconsider notonlythedangersol
theouter world, butalsotheobjections ofthe
super-ego, andhastherefore more occasion for
refraining fromsatisfyingthe instinct. While,
however, instinctual renunciation forexternal
reasons isonly painful, renunciation forinternal
reasons, inobedience tothedemands ofthesuper-
ego,hasanother economic effect. Itbrings
besides theinevitable painagaininpleasureto
theEgoasitwere, asubstitutive satisfaction.
TheEgofeelsuplifted;itisproud oftherenuncia-
tion asofavaluable achievement. Wethinkwe
canfollow themechanism ofthisgaininpleasure.
Thesuper-egoisthesuccessor andrepresentative
oftheparents (and educators), whosuperintended
theactions oftheindividual inhisfirstyearsof
life;itperpetuatestheir functions almost without
achange.ItkeepstheEgoinlasting dependence
and exercises asteady pressure. TheEgois
concerned, justasitwasinchildhood, toretain
theloveofitsmaster, and itfeels hisappreciation
asarelief and satisfaction, hisreproachesas
pricksofconscience. When theEgohasmade
thesacrifice tothesuper-ego ofrenouncing an
instinctual satisfaction,itexpectstoberewarded
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION185
bybeingloved allthemore. Theconsciousness
ofdeservingthislove isfeltaspride. Atatime
when theauthority wasnotyetinternalized as
super-egotherelation between thethreatened loss
ofloveandtheinstinctual demand would have
been thesame.Afeeling ofsecurity and satis-
faction results ifoutoflove toone'sparents one
achieves aninstinctual renunciation. Thisgood
feelingcouldacquirethepeculiarnarcissistic
character ofpride onlyafter theauthorityitself
hadbecome apartoftheEgo.
How does thisexplanationofgainingsatisfac-
tionthroughinstinctual renunciationhelpusin
understandingtheprocesses wewish tostudy,
namely,theincrease ofself-confidence that
accompanies progressinspirituality?Apparently
they helpvery little, forthecircumstances here
areverydifferent. There isnoinstinctual
renunciation, andthere isnosecondpersonor
higherstandard forwhose benefit thesacrifice is
made. Thesecond statement willsoonappear
doubtful. Onemight say:thegreatman isthe
authorityforwhose sake theeffort ismade, and
since thegreatman achieves thisbecause heisa
father substitute weneed notbesurprisedifhe
isallotted theroleofsuper -egoinmasspsychology.
This would, therefore, holdgoodfortheman
Moses inhisrelationshiptotheJewish people.
Inotherpoints, however, therewould seem tobe
noproper analogy. Theprogressinspirituality
186 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
consists indeciding against the direct sense
perceptioninfavour oftheso-called higher
intellectualprocesses,that istosay,infavour of
memories, reflection anddeduction. Anexample
ofthiswould bethedecision thatpaternityis
more importantthanmaternity, althoughthe
former cannot beproved bythesenses asthe
latter can. This iswhythechild hastohave the
father's name and inherit after him. Another
example would be:ourGod isthegreatest and
mightiest, although He isinvisible likethestorm
andthesoul.Rejectingasexual oraggressive
instinctual demand seems tobesomething very
different from this.Inmany examplesofprogress
inspiritualityforinstance, inthetriumphof
father-right wecannotpointtotheauthority
thatprovidesthemeasure forwhat istobevalued
themorehighly. Inthiscase itcannot bethe
father himself, since itisonlythisprogressthat
raises him totherank ofanauthority. Weare,
therefore, confronted with thephenomenonthat
duringthedevelopmentofmankind theworld of
thesenses becomesgraduallymastered byspiritu-
ality,andthatman feelsproud anduplifted by
eachsuchstepinprogress. Onedoesnotknow,
however, whythisshould beso. Still later it
happensthatspiritualityitself isoverpowered by
thealtogether mysterious emotional phenomenon
ofbelief. This isthefamous credoquiaabsurdum,
andwhoever hascompassedthisregardsitas

thehighestachievement. Perhaps what iscom-
mon toallthesepsychologicalsituations issome-
thingelse. Perhaps man declares simplythat
thehigher achievement iswhat ismore difficult
toattain, and hisprideinitisonlynarcissism
heightened byhisconsciousness ofhavingover-
come difficulty.
These considerations arecertainly notvery
fruitful, andonemightthink that theyhave
.nothingtodowithourinvestigationintowhat
determined thecharacter oftheJewish people.
Thiswould beonlytoouradvantage, butthat
thistrain ofthoughthas allthesame todowith
ourproblemisshown byafactthat willoccupy
uslater more extensively. Thereligionthat
beganwith theprohibition against making an
imageofitsGodhasdevelopedinthecourse of
centuries more andmore into areligionof
instinctual renunciation. Not that itdemands
sexual abstinence;itiscontent with aconsider-
able restriction ofsexual freedom. God, however,
becomes completelywithdrawn from sexuality
and raised toanideal ofethicalperfection.
Ethics, however, means restriction ofinstinctual
gratification.TheProphetsdidnot tireofmain-
tainingthatGoddemands nothingelsefrom his
peoplebutajustandvirtuous life: that istosay,
abstention from thegratificationofallimpulses
that accordingtoourpresent-daymoral stand-
ards aretobecondemned asvicious. Andeven
188 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
theexhortation tobelieve inGodseems torecede
incomparisonwith the seriousness ofthese
ethical demands. Instinctual renunciation thus
appearstoplayaprominent partinreligion,
althoughithadnotbeenpresentinitfrom the
beginning.
Here istheplacetomake astatement which
should obviate amisunderstanding. Thoughit
mayseem that instinctual renunciation, andthe
ethics based onit,donotbelongtotheessence of
religion,stilltheyaregenetically closelyrelated
toreligion. Totemism, the firstform ofreligion
ofwhich weknow, contains asanindispensable
partofitssystem anumber oflawsandprohibi-
tions whichplainly meannothingelse but
instinctual renunciation. There istheworship
oftheTotem, which contains theprohibition
against killingorharming it;exogamy,that is
tosay, therenunciation ofthepassionately
desired mothers and sisters ofthehorde; the
grantingofequal rightsforallmembers ofthe
brother horde,i.e.therestriction oftheimpulse
tosettle theirrivalry bybrute force. Inthese
ruleswehave todiscern the firstbeginnings ofa
moral and social order. Itdoesnotescape our
notice thatheretwodifferent motivations come
intoplay.The firsttwoprohibitions work inthe
direction ofwhat themurdered father would
have wished; they,sotospeak, perpetuatehis
will.The third law, theonegiving equal rights
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 189
tothebrothers, ignoresthefather's wishes. Its
sense liesintheneed ofpreserving permanently
thenew order which was established after the
death ofthefather. Otherwise reversion tothe
former statewould havebeen inevitable. Here
social lawsbecameseparatedfrom others which
aswemight say originated directly from a
religiouscontext.
Intheabbreviated developmentofthehuman
individual themost importantevents ofthat
processarerepeated.Here also itistheparents'
authority essentiallythat oftheall-powerful
father who wields thepowerofpunishment
thatdemands instinctual renunciation onthe

andwhat isforbidden. What thechild calls
"good"or"naughty"becomes later, when
society and super-egotake theplaceofthe
parents,"

virtuous orvicious. But itisstillthesamething:
instinctual renunciation throughthepresenceof
theauthority whichreplacedandcontinued that

Ourinsightintotheseproblemsbecomes further
deepened whenweinvestigatethestrangecon-
ceptionofsanctity. What isitreallythatappears"sacred"comparedwith other things whichwe
respect highly andadmit tobeimportant andsigni-
ficant ?Ontheonehand theconnection between
thesacred and thereligiousisunmistakable;
19OMOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
itissostressed astobeobvious. Everything
connected withreligionissacred;itisthe
verycore ofsanctity. Ontheother hand our
judgementisdisturbed bythenumerousattempts
tolayclaim tothecharacter ofholiness byso
manyotherthings, persons,institutions and
proceduresthathave little todowithreligion.
These endeavours areoftenplainlytendentious.
Letusproceedfrom thefeature ofprohibition
which adheres socloselytoreligion. Thesacred
isobviously somethingthatmust notbetouched.
Asacredprohibitionhasavery strongaffective

Forwhy should itbesuch aspeciallyhideous

When weaskforanexplanation weshallsurely

how toexplainit.
That suchanexplanationisillusory caneasily

AncientEgyptians andotherpeoples.Itwent
withoutsayingthateachPharaoh found hisfirst

todiscern that incest inthis casebetween
brother and sister wasaprerogative forbidden
toordinarymortals andreserved forkingswho

Greek andGermanic mythsalsotooknoexception
tothese incestuousrelationships. Wemaysurmise
that theanxious concern for"
family"inour
higher nobilityisaremnant ofthatoldprivilege,
andweobserve that, asaconsequenceofinbreed-
ingcontinued through many generationsinthe
highestsocialcircles, thecrowned heads of

Topointtotheincest ofgods, kingsandheroes
helpstodisposeofanotherattemptatexplanation,
namely,theonethatwouldexplainthehorror of

knowledgeoftheharmfulness ofinbreeding.It
isnoteven certain, however, that there liesany
dangerininbreeding;letalone thatprimitive

andtheimpossibilityofarational motivation:
192MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
inshort itssacredness. Ishould confidently
anticipatethataninvestigationofallother cases oi
sacredprohibitionswould lead tothesame result
asthatofthehorror ofincest, namelythatwhat is
sacred wasoriginally nothingbuttheperpetuated
willoftheprimaevalfather. Thiswould also
elucidate theambivalence oftheword hitherto

onlymean"sacred/5"

The willofthefather, however, wasnotonly
something which onemust nottouch, which one

which made oneshudder because itnecessitated

6.TheTruth inReligion
Howwewhohave little belief envythosewho
areconvinced oftheexistence ofaSupreme
Power, forwhom theworld holds noproblems
because HeHimself hascreated allitsinstitutions !
How comprehensive,exhaustive and final arethe
doctrines ofthebelievers comparedwith the
laboured, poorandpatchy attemptsatexplana-
tionwhich are the bestwecanproduce. The
DivineSpirit, which initself istheideal ofethical
perfection,hasplantedwithin thesoulofmen the
knowledge ofthisidealandatthesame time the
urgetostrive toward it.Theyfeelimmediately
what ishighandnoble andwhatlowandmean.
Their emotional life ismeasured bythedistance
from their ideal. Itaffords them high gratifica-
tionwhen theyinperihelion,sotospeak
come nearer toit;andtheyarepunished by
severe distress when inaphelion they have
N
194 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
moved further away from it.Allthis issosimply
andunshakablyestablished. Wecanonly regret
itifcertainexperiencesoflifeandobservations of
nature havemade itimpossibletoacceptthe
hypothesisofsuch aSupreme Being. Asifthe
world hadnotenough problems, wearecon-
fronted with thetaskoffinding outhowthosewho
have faith inaDivine Being could have acquired
it,andwhence thisbelief derives theenormous
powerthatenables ittooverwhelm Reason and
Science.1
Letusreturn tothemoremodestproblemthat
hasoccupiedussofar.We setouttoexplain
whence comes thepeculiarcharacter oftheJewish
people which inallprobabilityiswhat has
enabled thatpeopletosurvive untilto-day. We
found thatthemanMoses created their character
bygivingtothem areligion whichheightened
their self-confidence tosuch adegreethatthey
believed themselves tobesuperiortoallother
peoples. Theysurvived bykeepingaloof from
the others. Admixture ofblood made little
difference, since whatkeptthemtogether was
somethingideal thepossession they had in
common ofcertain intellectual andemotional
values. The Mosaicreligion had this effect
because(i)itallowed thepeopletoshare inthe
grandeurofitsnewconceptionofGod, (2)
1(Anallusion tothepassageinFaust"Verachte nurVernunft
undWissenschaft." Transl.)
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION195
because itmaintained thatthepeople hadbeen
"chosen"bythisgreatGodandwasdestined
toenjoytheproofsofhisspecial favour, and
(3)because itforced uponthepeopleapro-
gressinspirituality which, significant enough
initself, further openedthewaytorespectfor
intellectual work and tofurther instinctual
renunciations.
This then istheconclusion wehave attained,
but,althoughIdonotwish toretract anything
Ihave saidbefore,Icannothelp feelingthat itis
somehow notaltogether satisfactory. Thecause
does not, so tospeak,accord with the result.
The factwearetryingtoexplainseems tobe
incommensurate with everything weadduce by
wayofexplanation.Isitpossiblethat allour
investigations have sofardiscovered notthe
whole motivation, butonlyasuperficial layer, and
thatbehind this lieshidden another very signifi-
cantcomponent?Considering how extraordin-
arilycomplicatedallcausation inlifeandhistory
isweshould havebeen preparedforsomething
ofthatkind.
Thepathtothisdeepermotivation starts ata
certain passageinthepreviousdiscussion. The
religionofMoses didnotachieve itseffects
immediately, butinastrangelyindirect manner.
Thisdoesnotmean that itdidnotitselfproduce
the effect. Ittookalong time,many centuries,
todoso;that goeswithout saying where the
ig6MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
developmentofapeople'scharacter isconcerned.
Ourmodification, however, refers toafactwhich
wehave taken from thehistory ofJewish religion
or,ifoneprefers, introduced into it.Wesaid
that theJewish peopleshook offthereligion of
Moses afteracertain time; whethertheydidso
completelyorwhether they retained some ofits
precepts wecannot tell. Inacceptingthesup-
positionthatduringthelong periodofthefight
forCanaan, andthestruggles with thepeoples
settled there, theJahve religion didnotsub-
stantiallydiffer from theworshipoftheother
Baalim, westand onhistorical ground,inspiteof
allthelater tendentiousattemptstoobscure this
shamingstate ofaffairs. ThereligionofMoses,
however, hadnotperished. Asortofmemory of
ithad survived, obscured and distorted, but
perhaps supported byindividual members ofthe
Priest caste throughtheancientscripts.Itwas
thistradition ofagreat pastthatcontinued to
exert itseffect from thebackground;itslowly
attained moreandmorepowerovertheminds of
thepeople, andatlastsucceeded inchangingthe
godJahveintotheGodofMoses andinbringing
againtolifetheabandonedreligion Moses had
instituted centuriesago.
Inanearlierchapter ofthisbookwehave dis-
cussed thehypothesisthatwould seem tobe
inevitable ifwearetofindcomprehensible such

7.TheReturnoftheRepressed
There areanumber ofsimilarprocesses among
thosewhich theanalytic investigation ofmental
lifehasmadeknown tous.Some ofthem are
termedpathological;others arecounted among
thevarieties ofthenormal. This matterslittle,
however, forthelimits between thetwoarenot
strictly defined and themechanisms aretoa
certain extent thesame. Itismuch moreimpor-
tantwhether thechangesinquestion takeplace
intheegoitself orwhether they confront itas
alien; inthelatter casetheyarecalledsymptoms.
From thefullness ofthematerial atmydisposal
Iwillchoose cases thatconcern theformation of
character.
Ayoung girlhaddevelopedinto themost
decided contrast tohermother; shehad culti-
vated allthequalitiesshemissed inhermother
andavoided allthose thatreminded herofher
mother. Wemayadd that informeryears she
hadidentified herself with hermother likeany
other female child and had nowcome tooppose
thisidentificationenergetically. When thisgirl
married, however, andbecame awifeandmother
inherturn,wearesurprisedtofind that she
became moreandmore likethemother towards
whom shefeltsoinimical, until atlastthemother
198 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
identification shehadovercome hadoncemore
unmistakably won theday.Thesamething
happenswithboys, andeven thegreat Goethe,
who inhisSturm undDrang period certainly did
notrespecthispedantic and stiff father very
highly, developedinoldagetraits thatbelonged
tohisfather's character. This result willstand
outmorestrikingly where thecontrast between
thetwopersonsismorepronounced. Ayoung
man, whose fatewasdetermined byhishaving
togrow upwith agood-for-nothing father,
developedatfirst inspiteofthefather intoa
capable, trustworthy andhonourable man. In
theprime oflifehischaracter changed andfrom
nowonhebehaved asifhehadtaken thissame
father ashisexample. Soasnot tolosethe
connection withourtopicwemustkeepinmind
that atthebeginning ofsuch aprocessthere
alwaysexists anidentification with thefather
fromearly childhooddays.Thisgetsrepudiated,
even over-compensated, and intheendagain
comes tolight.
Ithaslongsincebecome common knowledge
thattheexperienceofthe first fiveyears ofchild-
hood exert adecisive influence onourlife,one
which later events opposeinvain.Much could
besaidabouthow theseearly experiencesresist
allefforts ofmore matureyearstomodify them,
butthiswould notberelevant. Itmaynotbeso
wellknown, however, thatthestrongestobsessive
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 199
influence derives from thoseexperiences which
thechild undergoesatatimewhenwehave
reason tobelieve hispsychical apparatustobe
incompletelyfitted foraccepting them. The fact
itselfcannot bedoubted, but itseems sostrange
thatwemight trytomake iteasier tounderstand
byasimile; theprocess maybecomparedtoa
photograph,which canbedeveloped andmade
intoapictureafterashort orlonginterval. Here
Imay point out,however, thatanimaginative
writer, with theboldnesspermittedtosuch
writers, made thisdisconcerting discovery before
me. E.T.A.Hoffmann used toexplainthe
wealth ofimaginative figuresthat offered them-
selves tohim for his stories bythequickly
changing pictures andimpressionshehadreceived
duringajourneyinapost-chaise, lastingfor
several weeks, while hewas stillababe athis
mother's breast. What achild hasexperienced
andnotunderstood bythetimehehasreached
theageoftwohemaynever again remember,
exceptinhisdreams. Only through psycho-
analytic treatment willhebecome aware ofthose
events. Atanytime inlateryears, however, they
maybreak into hislifewith obsessiveimpulsive-
ness, direct hisactions, forcehim tolikeordislike
people andoften decide the choice ofhislove-
object byapreferencethat sooften cannot be
rationally defended. Thetwopointsthattouch
onourproblemareunmistakable. They are,

here asthereallydecisive factor, as,forinstance,

8.TheHistorical Truth
Wehavemade allthesepsychological digressions
tomake itmore credible that thereligionoJ
Moses exercised influence ontheJewish people
Onlywhen ithadbecome atradition. Wehave
2O2 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
scarcelyachieved more than aprobability. Yet
letusassume wehave succeeded inprovingthis
conclusively;theimpression would stillremain
thatwehad satisfied onlythequalitativefactor
ofourtask, notthequantitativeaswell.Toall
matters concerningthecreation ofareligion
andcertainlytothatoftheJewish onepertains
something majestic, which hasnotsofarbeen
covered byourexplanations. Some other element
should havepartinit:onethathasfewanalogies
andnothing quitelikeit,something unique and
commensurate with thatwhich hasgrown outof
it,somethinglikereligionitself.
Letusseeifwecanapproachoursubject from
thereverse side.Weunderstand thatprimitive
manneeds aGod ascreator oftheworld, ashead
ofhistribe, and asonewho takes careofhim.
ThisGod takes hisplace behind thedead fathers
ofwhom tradition stillhassomethingtorelate.
Man inlater times ofourtime, forinstance
behavessimilarly. Healsoremains infantile and
needsprotection, evenwhen heisfullygrown;
hefeelshecannotrelinquishthesupportofhis
God. Somuch isindisputable,but itisnotso
easilytobeunderstood whythere must beonly
oneGod,whyjusttheprogress fromHenotheism
toMonotheismacquiressuchanoverwhelming
significance.Itistrue, aswehave mentioned
before, that the believerparticipatesinthe
greatness ofhisGodandthemorepowerfulthe
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION203
Jodthesurer theprotectionhecanbestow. The
powerofaGod, however, need notpresuppose
hisbeing anonlyGod: many peoples only
glorifiedtheir chiefgodthemore ifheruled over
amultitude ofinferior gods; hewasnottheless
greatbecause there were other gods than He.
Italsomeantsacrificing some oftheintimate
relationshipiftheGodbecame universal and
cared equallyforalllandsandpeoples. Onehad,
sotospeak,toshare one'sGodwithstrangers and
had tocompensateoneself forthatbybelieving
thatonewasfavoured byhim.Thepoint could
bemade that theconceptionofanOnlyGod
signifiesastepforward inspirituality;thispoint,
however, cannot beestimated sovery highly.
Thetruebeliever knows ofawayadequatelyto
fillinthisobvious gapinmotivation. Hesays
thattheideaofanOnlyGodhashad thisover-
whelmingeffect onmankind because itispartof
eternal truth, which, hidden forsolong,hasat
lastcome tolightandhassweptallbefore it.
Wehave toadmit thatatlastwehaveanelement
ofanorder commensurate tothegreatnessof
thesubjectaswell astothatofthesuccess ofits
influence.
Ialso should like toacceptthis solution.
However,Ihavemymisgivings. Thereligious
argumentisbased on anoptimisticand idealistic
premiss. Thehuman intellect hasnotshown
itself elsewhere tobeendowed with averygood
2O4 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
scent fortruth, norhasthehuman mind dis-
played anyspecialreadiness toaccepttruth.On
thecontrary,itisthegeneral experiencethatthe
human intellect errsvery easily without our
suspectingitatall,and thatnothingismore
readilybelieved thanwhatregardlessofthe
truth meets ourwishes and illusionshalf-way.
That iswhy ouragreement needsmodifying.
Itooshould credit thebeliever's solution with
containingthetruth;itisnot,however, the
material truth, butanhistorical truth. Iwould
claim therighttocorrect acertain distortion
which thistruthunderwent onitsre-emergence.
That istosay:Idonotbelieve thatonesupreme
greatGod"exists"
to-day, butIbelieve that in
primaevaltimes therewasoneperson whomust
needs appear gigantic andwho, raised tothe
status ofadeity, returned tothememoryofmen.
Oursupposition wasthatthereligionofMoses
wasdiscarded andpartly forgotten andthat later
on itforced itselfontothenotice ofthepeople
asatradition. Imake theassumptionthat this
processwas therepetitionofanearlier one.
When Moses gavetohispeopletheconception
ofanOnlyGod itwasnotanaltogether new
idea, for itmeant there-animation ofprimaeval
experienceinthehuman family thathadlong
agofaded from theconscious memoryofmankind.
Theexperience wassuchanimportant one,how-
ever,andhadproduced,oratleastprepared,
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 205
suchfar-reaching changesinthe lifeofman, that,
Icannothelp thinking,itmust have leftsome
permanenttrace inthehuman soul something
comparabletoatradition.
Thepsycho-analysesofindividuals havetaught
usthat their earliestimpressions,received ata
timewhen theywerehardlyable totalk,manifest
themselves later inanobsessive fashion, although
thoseimpressionsthemselves arenotconsciously
remembered. We feelthat thesame must hold
goodforthe earliestexperiencesofmankind.
One result ofthis istheemergenceofthecon-
ceptionofonegreat God. Itmust berecognized
asamemory, adistorted one,itistrue,butnever-
theless amemory.Ithasanobsessivequality;
itsimply mustbebelieved. Asfarasitsdistortion
goesitmaybecalled adelusion; insofarasit
bringstolight something from thepastitmust
becalled truth. Thepsychiatricdelusion also
contains aparticleoftruth; thepatient'scon-
viction issues from thisandextends tothewhole
delusional fabrication surroundingit.
Thefollowing pagescontain ascarcelyaltered
repetitionofwhat Isaidinthe first section. In
1912Itried inmybook Totem andTaboo to
reconstruct theancient situation fromwhich all
these effects issued. Inthatbook Imade useof
certain theoretical reflections ofCharles Darwin,
Atkinson, andespeciallyRobertson Smith, and
combined them withfindings andsuggestions
2O6 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
from psycho -analytic practice. From Darwin I
borrowed thehypothesisthatmenoriginally
lived insmall hordes;each ofthehordes stood
under theruleofanolder male,whogoverned
bybrute force, appropriatedallthefemales and
belaboured orkilled alltheyoung males, includ-
inghisown sons.From Atkinson Ireceived the
suggestionthat thispatriarchal system came toan
endthrougharebellion ofthesons,whounited
againstthefather, overpoweredhimandtogether
consumed hisbody. Following Robertson Smith's
totem theoryIsuggestedthat thishorde, pre-
viouslyruled bythefather, wasfollowed bya
totemistic brother clan. Inorder tobeable to
live inpeacewith oneanother thevictorious
brothers renounced thewomen forwhose sake
theyhadkilled thefather, andagreedtopractise
exogamy. Thepowerofthefather wasbroken
andthefamiliesregulated bymatriarchy. The
ambivalence ofthesons towards the father
remained inforce duringthewhole further
development.Instead ofthefather acertain
animal wasdeclared thetotem;itstood fortheir
ancestor andprotecting spirit,andnoonewas
allowed tohurtorkill it.Once ayear, however,
thewhole clanassembled forafeast atwhich the
otherwise revered totem wastorn topieces and
eaten.Noonewaspermittedtoabstain from this
feast;itwasthesolemnrepetitionofthefather-
murder, inwhich social order, moral lawsand
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 2O7
religion hadhad theirbeginnings. The cor-
respondenceofthetotem feast(accordingto
Robertson Smith'sdescription) with theChristian
Communion has struck many authors before
me.
Istilladhere tothissequenceofthought.I
have often beenvehemently reproachedfornot
changing myopinionsinlater editions ofmy
book, sincemore recentethnologists havewithout
exceptiondiscarded Robertson Smith's theories
andhave inpartreplaced thembyothers which
differextensively.Iwouldreplythat these
alleged advances inscience arewellknown tome.
Yet Ihave riotbeen convinced either oftheir
correctness orofRobertson Smith's errors. Con-
tradiction isnotalways refutation; anewtheory
doesnotnecessarily denoteprogress. Above all,
however, Iamnotanethnologist, butapsycho-
analyst.Itwasmygood righttoselect from
ethnological datawhat would servemeformy
analytic work. Thewritingsofthehighly gifted
Robertson Smith provided mewith valuable
pointsofcontact with thepsychologicalmaterial
ofanalysis andsuggestionsfortheuseofit.I
cannot saythesame ofthework ofhisopponents.
9.TheHistoricalDevelopment
Icannotreproducehere thecontents ofTotem
andTaboo, but Imusttrytoaccount forthelong
2O8 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
interval that tookplace between theevents
which wesuggested happenedinprimaevaltimes
andthevictoryofmonotheism inhistorical times.
After thecombination ofbrother clan, matriarchy,
exogamy andtotemism hadbeen established
there began adevelopment which may be
described asaslow"return oftherepressed.55
Theterm"
repressed55
ishere used notinits
technical sense. Here Imean something past,
vanished andovercome inthe lifeofapeople,
which Iventure totreat asequivalenttorepressed
material inthemental lifeoftheindividual. In
whatpsychological form thepastexisted during
itsperiodofdarkness wecannot asyettell. Itis
noteasytotranslate theconceptsofindividual
psychologyintomasspsychology, and Idonot
think thatmuch istobegained byintroducing
theconceptofa"collective"unconscious the
content oftheunconscious iscollective anyhow,
ageneral possessionofmankind. Sointhemean-
time theuseofanalogies musthelpusout.The
processes westudy here inthe lifeofapeopleare
verysimilar tothoseweknow frompsycho-
pathology,but stilltheyarenotquitethesame.
Wemustconclude thatthemental residue ofthose
primaevaltimes hasbecome aheritage which,
with eachnewgeneration,needs onlytobe
awakened, nottobere-acquired. Wemaythink
hereoftheexampleofspeech symbolism, which
certainly seems tobeinborn. Itoriginatesinthe
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 2OQ
timeofspeech development, and itisfamiliar to
allchildren without their having beenspecially
instructed. Itisthesame inallpeoplesinspite
ofthedifferences inlanguage. Whatwemaystill
lack incertainty wemay acquire from other
results ofpsycho -analytic investigations. We
learn thatourchildren inanumber ofsignificant
relationships donotreact astheirownexperiences
would lead ustoexpect, but instinctively,like
animals; this isexplicable onlybyphylogenetic
inheritance.
The return oftherepressed proceeds slowly;
itcertainlydoes notoccurspontaneously,but
under theinfluence ofallthechangesinthe
conditions oflifethatabound throughoutthe
history ofcivilization. Icangivehere neither a
survey oftheconditions onwhich itdependsnor
anymore thanascanty enumeration ofthestages
inwhich thereturnproceeds. Thefather became
again thehead ofthefamily, buthewasno
longer omnipotentasthefather oftheprimaeval
horde hadbeen. Inclearly recognizabletransi-
tionalstagesthetotem animal wasousted bythe
god.Thegod,inhuman form,stillcarried at
firstthehead ofananimal;lateronhewaswont
toassume theguise ofthesame animal. Still
later theanimal became sacred tohimand his
favourite companionorelsehewasreputedto
have slain theanimal, when headded itsname
tohisown. Between thetotem animal andthe
2IO MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
godtheheromade hisappearance;thiswas
oftenanearly stage ofdeification. Theideaofa
Highest Being seems tohaveappeared early;at
first itwasshadowy anddevoid ofanyconnection
with thedailyinterests ofmankind. Asthetribes
andpeoples were knittogetherintolargerunities
thegodsalsobecame organizedintofamilies and
hierarchies. Often oneofthem waselevated to
betheoverlord ofgodsandmen.Thenextstep,
toworship onlyoneGod,wastakenhesitatingly,
and atlonglast thedecision wasmade to
concede allpowertooneGodonlyandnotto
suffer anyothergodsbeside him.Only thenwas
thegrandeuroftheprimaevalfather restored;
theemotions belongingtohimcouldnowbe
repeated.
The first effect ofthereunion withwhatmen
hadlongmissed andyearnedforwasoverwhelm-
ingandexactlyasthetradition ofthelaw-giving
onMount Sinaidepictsit.There wasadmiration,
aweandgratitudethat thepeople hadfound
favour inHiseyes:thereligion ofMoses knows of
onlythesepositive feelingstowards theFather-
God. The conviction that Hispower was
irresistible, thesubjectiontoHis will,could not
have been more absolute with thehelpless,
intimidated sonofthefather ofthehorde than
theywere here; indeed, theybecomefullycom-
prehensible onlybythetransformation intothe
primitive and infantile milieu. Infantilefeelings
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 211
arefarmore intense andinexhaustibly deepthan
arethose ofadults; only religious ecstasy can
bring back thatintensity. Thus atransportof
devotion toGod isthe firstresponsetothereturn
oftheGreat Father.
The direction ofthisFatherreligionwasthus
fixed for alltime, but itsdevelopmentwasnot
therebyfinished. Ambivalency belongstothe
essence ofthefather -son relationship ;ithad to
happenthat inthecourse oftime thehostility
should bestirred which inancient times had
spurredthesons toslaytheir admired and
dreaded father. InthereligionofMoses itself
there wasnoroom fordirectexpressionofthe
murderous father-hate. Onlyapowerfulreaction
toitcouldmake itsappearance:theconscious-
nessofguilt because ofthat hostility,thebad
conscience because onehadsinned against God
andcontinued so to sin.Thisfeelingofguiltiness,
which theProphets incessantly keptaliveand
which soonbecame anintegral partofthe
religious system itself, hadanother, superficial,
motivation which cleverlyveiled thetrueorigin
ofthefeeling. Thepeople metwithhard times;
thehopesbased onthefavour ofGodwereslow in
being fulfilled;itbecame noteasytoadhere to
the illusion, cherished above allelse, thatthey
wereGod's chosenpeople.Iftheywished tokeep
happiness,thentheconsciousness ofguiltbecause
they themselves were such sinners offered a
212 MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
welcome excuse forGod'sseverity. They deserved
nothingbetter than tobepunished byHim,
because theydidnotobserve thelaws; theneed
forsatisfyingthisfeelingofguilt, which coming
fromamuchdeepersource wasinsatiable, made
them render theirreligious preceptseverandever
morestrict, moreexacting, butalsomorepetty.
Inanewtransportofmoral asceticism theJews
imposed onthemselves constantly increasing
instinctual renunciation, andthereby reached
atleast indoctrine andpreceptsethical heights
thathadremained inaccessible totheother
peoplesofantiquity. Many Jews regardthese
aspirationsasthesecond main characteristic, and
thesecondgreat achievement, oftheirreligion.
Ourinvestigationisintended toshowhow itis
connected with the firstone, theconceptionof
theoneandonlyGod. Theorigin, however, of
thisethics infeelings ofguilt, duetotherepressed
hostilitytoGod, cannot begainsaid.Itbears the
characteristic ofbeing never concluded andnever
able tobeconcluded withwhich wearefamiliar
inthereaction -formations oftheobsessional
neurosis.
The further developmenttranscends Judaism.
Other elements re-emerging from thedrama
enacted around thepersonoftheprimaeval
father were innowaytobereconciled with the
Mosaicreligion. The consciousness ofguiltin
thatepoch wasnolongerrestricted totheJews;
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 213
ithad seized allMediterraneanpeoplesasa
vague discomfort, apremonitionofmisfortune
thereason forwhich no oneknew. Modern
history speaksoftheageing ofantiqueculture.
Iwould surmise that ithasapprehended only
some ofthecasual andadjuvant causes forthe
mood ofdejection thenprevailing among the
peoples. Thelighteningofthatoppression
proceededfrom theJews. Although food forthe
ideahadbeen provided bymany suggestive
hintsfrom variousquarters,itwas, nevertheless,
inthemind ofaJew, Saul ofTarsus, who asa
Roman citizen wascalled Paul, thatthepercep-
tiondawned: "it isbecause wekilledGod the
Father thatwearesounhappy.'5Itisquiteclear
tousnowwhyhecouldgraspthistruth inno
other formbutinthedelusionalguiseoftheglad
tidings:"wehavebeen delivered from allguilt
since oneofuslaiddown hislifetoexpiate our
guilt.55Inthisformulation themurder ofGod
was, ofcourse, notmentioned, butacrime that
had tobeexpiated byasacrificial death could
onlyhavebeenmurder. Further, theconnection
between thedelusion andthehistorical truthwas
established bytheassurance that the sacrificial
victim wastheSonofGod.Thestrength which
thisnew faith derived from itssource inhistorical
truth enabled ittoovercome allobstacles; inthe
placeoftheenrapturing feeling ofbeingthe
chosen ones there came now release through
214MOSES ANDMONOTHEISM
salvation.^Thefactofthefather-murder, how-
ever,hadonitsreturn tothememory ofmankind
toovercome greaterobstacles than theonewhich
constituted theessence ofmonotheism;ithadto
undergo amore extensive distortion. Theun-
mentionable crime wasreplaced bythetenet of
thesomewhat shadowy conceptionoforig-
inal sin.
Originalsinand salvation throughsacrificial
death became the basis ofthenewreligion
founded byPaul. Thequestionwhether there
wasaleader andinstigatortothemurder among
thehorde ofbrothers who rebelledagainstthe
primaeval father, orwhether thatfigure was
created laterbypoetswho identified themselves
with theheroandwasthen incorporatedinto
tradition, must remain unanswered. After the
Christian doctrine had burst theconfines of
Judaism,itabsorbed constituents frommany
other sources, renounced manyfeatures ofpure
monotheism andadoptedinmany particulars
theritual oftheother Mediterraneanpeoples.
ItwasasifEgypt hadcome towreak hervenge-
anceontheheirs ofIkhnaton. Thewayinwhich
thenewreligion came toterms with theancient
ambivalencyinthefather -sonrelationshipis
noteworthy.Itsmain doctrine, tobesure,was
the reconciliation withGod theFather, the
expiationofthecrime committedagainst Him;
buttheother sideoftherelationshipmanifested
HISPEOPLE ANDMONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 215
itself intheSonwhohadtaken theguiltonhis
shoulders becoming God himself beside the
Father and intruth inplaceoftheFather.
OriginallyaFatherreligion, Christianity became
aSonreligion. The fateofhavingtodisplacethe
Father itcould notescape.
Only apartoftheJewish people acceptedthe
new doctrine. Those who refused todosoare
stillcalled Jews. Throughthisdecision they are
stillmoresharply separatedfrom therestofthe
world than theywere before. Theyhadtosuffer
thereproach from thenewreligious community
which besides Jews includedEgyptians, Greeks,
Syrians, Romans andlastlyalsoTeutons that
theyhadmurdered God. Initsfullform this
reproach would run:"
theywillnotadmit that

what truth liesbehind thisreproach. Whythe
Jews were unable toparticipateintheprogress
which this confession tothemurder ofGod
betokened(inspiteofall itsdistortion) might
