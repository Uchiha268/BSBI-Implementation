AQUESTION which seems natural andalmost unavoidable
arises: What canonesayabout abook, andalittleone at
that,which isforty years old,andwhich issupposedlynotone
ofthemostimpressive or"spectacular"bitsofFreud's many
writings? Thequestion presupposestheimplied answer that
forty yearseven inourswift-moving world isalong time, that
thebook inquestionistherefore more orlesssuperannuated
anddeserves butarespectfulhistorical glancebefore weput
itbackontheshelf togather more dust.
Itisobvious thattheabove isarhetorical wayofsaying
thatforty years after itsappearance andtwenty yearsafter
Freud's death, BeyondthePleasurePrinciplestilldeserves
considerable attention, andthatthereader would dowell if
hereads itwith studiouscuriosity. Ofrecentyearswehave
become soaccustomed totheatmosphereofcontroversy
which surroundspsychoanalysis andFreud thatwehave al-
most lostourcapacitytopickupabookonpsychoanalysis
without wantingtoknow inadvance whether thebook isfor
oragainst it,or, ifitisfor it,whether itisforFreud orfor
Jung, or, ifitisFreudian, whether itisorthodox orneo-
Freudian. Ifwedared tobefrank with ourselves, wewould
havenodifficultyinadmitting thatourjudgment ofpsycho-
analysisisactually fragmentary andnottooprofound. We
could alsoadmit thatsome sortofpartisanship possesses us,
and that therefore wearepreoccupiedwith "takingsides"
longbefore wegetacquaintedwith theveryfirstelements of
psychoanalysisandthemany-sidednessofthesubject.
Itisbecause ofthevariousprejudices which have incul-
cated themselves intopsychoanalyticalandnonpsychoanalyti-
calcircles that itispertinenttoinvite both theinitiated and
theuninitiated reader tosuspendhisfragmentary judgment

forashort while andre-read afresh the littlebook that is
here offered, andacquaintorre-acquainthimself with the
sound ofFreud's written voice, with hiswayofsaying things,
andthenwith thesubstance ofwhathehastosay.
Anintroduction isnotsupposedtoexplaininadvance
what issaidinthebook; still less isitmeant tointerpretit.
Rather, itisintended toclarify some shadows andpoint to
certainlights which willpossiblysetthebook inaproper
perspective.
Bearingthisinmind, letusfirst recall thatFreud wrote
BeyondthePleasurePrinciple when hewassixty-four years
oldamatureageindeed andatatimewhenpsychoanalysishadalready achieved considerablepopularity, eventhoughit
was stillpossibletoassess thedegree ofitsimportance bythe
number ofenemies ithad.Thetoneofthebook, themanner-
ismsofitsstylearevigorous, poignant, almostcontroversial;
Freud itseems was stillcombattinghisopponents rather than
tryingtoinstruct hisproponents. Almost tothelastyears of
hislife,Freudpreservedthiscombativevigor ofwriting, and
inBeyond thePleasurePrinciple thisaspect ofstyle stands
outmarkedly, particularly when heemphasizes hisclaim that
heisapartisanofnospecial philosophy andthatheisindif-
ferent astowhether whathehastosaydoesordoesnot fitanyknownphilosophy.
This claim forindependenceischaracteristic ofFreud's
personality andofallhiswritings, but Ibelieve itinnowaycastsaspersion onhisoriginality orhisgenius,ifIsaythat
thisdeclaratory independence should notbetaken too seri-
ously.Noone,andparticularly nogenius,isreally freeofthe
ideological inheritance which hecarries within himself asa
child ofagiven generation. Hemaynotbeaware ofit,of
course, butFreud would havebeen thelastman intheworld
toequate notbeing aware ofsomething with itsnonexistence.For itwasofcourse Freud himself whodiscovered andun-
folded before usthestaggering richness andpower within usofsomany things ofwhichwearenotaware.
Itisofsome interest inthisconnection torecall thatFreuddenied everhaving beenacquainted with thewritings of
Schopenhauer andNietzsche before heformulated many of
hisideas. Itwasbeyond anydoubt anhonest denial. Yet itisamatter ofrecord thatHitschmann, oneoftheearliest ad-

herents ofFreud, read apaperinFreud's house asearlyas
1905 (Freud being present,ofcourse) ontheverysubjectof
Nietzsche's ideas ascomparedwithsome ofFreud's theories.
There isnodoubt that, whether ornotFreud everread

psychology which wefind inFreud's letters toFliess, we
cannothelpbutbestruck bythedepth, diapason andim-
mense horizons which Freudenvisagedastheculmination
ofhissystem. And these letters, wemust remember, were
written before 1900, that istosay,before thefirstbook(The
Interpretation ofDreams) whichreally launchedpsycho-
analysisintothestormywaters ofaworld which never was
abletoapproachthestudy ofthepsychologyofmanwithout

which Freud's mind wasfiredfrom thevery outset, and his
particular goalofdiscovering, oruncovering,therealnature
ofman's mind, predestined him asathinker andaman to
become astorm center foryearstocome.

doconfuse stubbornness forconsistency, andrigidity ofsci-

Atany rate,BeyondthePleasurePrincipleisoneofthe

cannot befully graspedandeven lessunderstood unless one
alwaysbears inmind theinnerpsychological atmosphere in
which Freud worked inorder toexpresshisideas.
His literary stylewasalways terse, straightforward, clear
andchallengingly frank; butthesame thing cannot besaid
about theemotional climate ofhisthought.First ofall,
Freud never gaveuphisbelief Iamtemptedtosayfaith
thattheparallelhedrewbetween Fechner's ideas inphysics
and hisown inhumanpsychologywasnotreally aparallel
butanactualproofthathisconceptofthementalapparatus
and itsenergywas actuallythesame asHelmholtz' and
Fechner's ideasaboutphysical energy. Tothisfaith heclung
tothe last,expressingthehopethatsome daythewhole com-
plexityofhuman reactions andrelations could bereduced
tosome asyetundiscovered physico-chemicalreactions. In
other words, Freud remained anorganicist throughouthis
scientific life.Butgenius andliving paradoxthathewas,
Freud wasrejected bythematerialists(conservativeaswell
asMarxian) because ofhisalleged mysticism; andhewas
rejected bytheidealists andreligiousthinkers because hewas
thought tobeamaterialist.
The contradictions intowhich Freud's detractors thus
stumbled remained unnoticed asarule, butFreud wasof
course aware ofthemandsawinthem merelyasignofgen-
eralresistance. Yet itwasnotonlythat.ToFreud theepithet,
"mystic," wasanexpressionofopprobrium, andyetitwas
Freudwho stated thatsaints weresaved from severe neuroses
bytheir sainthood, their faith; hementioned inthisconnec-
tion St.Francis ofAssisi.Hewhostudies thelivesofthesaints
would noteasily issue toallofthem, andwithout reservation,
acertificate ofpsychological health. They were saints because
theywere able tostand thepressure oftheirrespectiveneu-
roses rather thanbecausetheydidnotsuffer from them.The
lives ofSt.Ignatius Loyola, orSanFrancisco Xavier, orSt.
Augustine forthatmatter, offerample confirmation ofmy
viewpoint.
Asonestudies Freud, onecandevelopthestrong suspicion
thathewasmore attractedbymany mystics thanbyphysico-
chemicalhypotheses, andthathestruggled with allthemight
ofhisgreatmindagainst openly givingintotheattraction
ofthemystical aspectsofhuman life.Inother words, theman
INTRODUCTION xi
who lessthantwenty yearsafterhewrote BeyondthePleasure
Principlewrote hisMoses andMonotheism, themanwho
some fiveyearsbefore BeyondthePleasure Principlewrote
thearticle onMichelangelo's Moses, seems throughoutthis
spanoftime tohavebeen preoccupiedwith thegreatnessof
human intuitions andtheuniversality ofhuman strivings not
onlytosolve buttoparticipateinthemysteriesoflife.And
itisperhapsbecause ofthisinclination thatFreudgave signs
of"protestingtoomuch."(Perhapstoothis isoneofthe
reasons whyhisarticle onMichelangelo's Moses appeared
firstanonymously;itwasonlymuch later that itwasadmitted
thatFreud, theEditor-in-chief oftheZeitschrift furPsycho-
analyse, wastherealauthor ofthearticle.)
While thecomplex questionofFreud's intellectualstrug-
gleswith hisownideas isfarfrom solved, there islittledoubt
thattheaggressive, trenchant, emphatictone ofhiswritings,
which seem tobefullofconviction anddevoid ofdoubt, does
notfullyconvey Freud's struggle with hisown ideas, which
attimes must havereached heroic dimensions. Itisbecause
ofFreud'saggressive candor, itseems tome,that hisearliest
followers seemmore tohave stood inawe, listeningtohis
pronouncements,thanactuallytohave assimilated his
thoughtlike truedisciples, readytoaskfriendlycritical
questionsinorder todeepen andbroaden theunderstanding
oftheir master'sthought. Theveryfewofhisfollowers who
wereendowed withtruly original minds andtrulyambitious
perspicacity andintuition soon broke with Freud; Jungis
oneofthefewonecanciteinthisrespect. Themajoritybe-
came eithersurly,hostile enemies rather than scientificop-
ponentsor admiring,enthusiastic followers rather than
scientific collaborators.
Itistherefore ofparticularinterest tonote thatthere was
hardly apsychoanalystoutside Freud himself whoevermade
anoriginal contribution tothetheory andpractice ofpsycho-
analysis;this isparticularlytrue ofthetimewhen Freud
wrote hisBeyondthePleasurePrinciple. Theoneexception
onecancitewithcertainty wasKarlAbraham, whomade an
inestimable contribution totheclinical understanding of
character formation andofdepression,acontribution which
wasspontaneously and"painlessly" incorporatedinto the
bodyofpsychoanalytic knowledge some fiveyearsbefore the
xii BEYOND THEPLEASURE PRINCIPLE
appearanceofBeyondthePleasurePrinciple. Buteven in
thecaseofAbraham things werenot allclarity andsunshine;
many ofhiscolleagues were notverykindly disposed tothe
man,andFreud himself, asJoneshaswritten, said thathe
wassuspiciousofhis"Prussian mind" Abrahambeinga
Berliner.
Alloftheabove amounts tosayingthattheconstant and
"true" followers ofFreud were notvery original minds; they
were notmediocrities, butforsome reason theywould not
orperhapscould not"speak up'*until Freudspokefirst. It
ispartlybecause ofthisthatBeyondthePleasurePrinciple
acquiredsuch significanceinthehistoryofthedevelopment
ofFreudianpsychoanalysis.Itacquiredthereputation ofa
landmark inhowFreud changedhismind andhowdaring
hewasindoingso.Asamatter ofcold fact,thebook isan
important contribution, athrust forward inthegrowth of
Freudian thought; but ifonereads itcarefully onewilleasily
seethatFreud didnotchangehismind, andthatBeyondthe
PleasurePrincipledidnotoverthrow anyoldpsychoanalytic
regime nordid itestablish anynewone. Itwasnotevena
smallvillage revolution; itwasand isalandmark offurther
developmentandaconsolidation oftheolderpathways.
BeyondthePleasurePrincipleiswhat itsays;itgoesalittle

This writerlaysnoclaim toanunderstanding ofFreud's
writingbetter thananyone's elsewhoapproaches Freud with
theearnestness hedeserves andthetolerance which isim-
perative, evennowsome twenty yearsafter Freud's death. I
say"even now" forthefollowing reason; atthebeginning
Freud had tosuffer from themany whosequick andever

wemaylookcalmly andobjectively.
Since itisnotinanyone's powertoslowdown ortoaccel-
erate thesalutary passageoftime, itcannot betheambition
ofthiswriter toattempttodoso.But thismuch itislegiti-
mate forhim toessaytodo: topointoutthatthevigorof
Freud's thought, stimulatingasithasalways beenand is,is
frequentlyobscured byhisattimes toohasty terminological
innovations. Notthatoneobjectstosuch innovations, orthat
oneoughttoinsist onsemantichair-splitting; butFreud,
whose clarityofthought anddaringintellectualimprovisa-
tionswerealways impressive andenlightening,suffered not
infrequently from acertain confusion, atfirstunnoticeable
but atlength presenting animpedimenttoeasyorclear
understanding. BeyondthePleasurePrincipleserves asan
excellent example.
First, there isthetendency whichimperceptibly grewinto
assertive tradition that, having gone beyond thepleasure
principle,heabandoned thatprinciple. This, asIhave al-
ready said, isnottrue.The reader, bearingthisinmind, can-
not failbutsee itonce thetext isperusedwithoutprejudice,
without theunwitting psychologicaltwistwhich makes him
readBeyondthePleasurePrinciple andassume that the
pleasure principlewas leftbehind. Wemightaswell state
righthere thattheassiduous andfaithful translators ofFreud,
inbringing before theEnglish-speakingreaders Freud's ver-
sionofthepleasure-pain theory, didnothelpmatters when
theycoined aneologism, "unpleasure."Thisawkward term
issupposedtorender somewhataccuratelytheGerman term
Unlust. Itisnotanexactly successful rendition(except
etymologically, perhaps). Thefeelingofpain,ofdiscomfort,
ofthatdisagreeable malaise which Freud hasinmind isnot
perceivedast/n-pleasure,forwhatwefeelinthismalaise we
feelpositively, andnotnegativelyasalackofsomethingelse.
Thispointneednotbelabored; itisbrought outheremerely
toillustrate how difficult itistotellthereader what agiven

Now letusaskourselves whatappearstobenewandnot
allegedly abandoned asoldinBeyondthePleasurePrinciple.

Theconceptof"compulsive repetition" or"repetition
compulsion." Some stillquarrelwith thisconcept, some no
longerdo.Theargumentsforandagainstitareofnopar-
ticular importancehere.What isimportantisthatnew con-
cepts, newly formulated, require greater clarityofdefinition.
Freud discovered therepetitivenessofcertainpatterns of
human behavior andtheinevitability or, ifyou wish, the
inescapablenature ofthisrepetitiveness. Andhecalled this
phenomenon "repetition compulsion"or"compulsive repe-
tition."
Wehavebecome accustomed totheterm"compulsion"
whenwespeakofcompulsionneuroses inother words, a
neurosis which makes thesufferer therefrom aware thathe
is"compelled bysomething"tomake thisorthatgesture or
thisorthatturn orelsehefeels uncomfortable, uneasy,at
timesplainlyanxious. Itishardly necessarytogointomore
detail toobserve thatthecompulsiveelement ofwhich Freud
speaks when hespeaksofcompulsive repetitionissomething
thattheindividual isnotconscious of,thatthecompulsive
element inthisconceptissomething which isnotneurotic
atall,ornotnecessarily, and that itisjustasornomore
compulsivethanbreathingorthechangingoftheseasons. To
usetheterm"compulsive"hereconnotessomethingthat itis
notandimplies things which arenotnecessarily there a
ratherstrange semantic fuzziness onthepartofthatuniquely
clear-minded thinker. Such unclarities arestrewnthroughout
many ofFreud'swritings andtranslations, and iftheydonot
alwaysconfuse thecasual reader oreven thestudent, one
would dowell inbeing forewarned andtherefore inreading
andstudying Freud withconsiderable caution andprudence.Onemoreexample:thesecond major innovation which
Freud introduced intopsychoanalytic thinking wasthecon-
ceptofthedeath instinct. Nowwehavebecome accustomed,
particularlysince Freudemphasized theroleofinstincts in
theconscious andunconscious lifeofman, toconsider an
instinct adrive, animpulsive orperpetually compellingas-
pirationtogratifyaneed. InGerman, Freud usesthewords
Trieb andTriebhaft,which mean instinct, instinctual drive,
asense ofbeing driven toward acertain eventhough not
always comprehended goal.Under thecircumstances, the
term "death instinct"ought tomean anaspiration,adrive to

bedead. Perhaps Freud wasright, eventhough neither the
biologist northetheologian would find itpossibletoagree
withhim.Letusassume thatFreud wasright; hecertainly
didnotprovehiscase, because there isnothinginstinctual
about dying, eventhough theend isinevitable. Here again
wefindastrange semantic orterminological confusion, a
tendencytouseterms which arefamiliar tousinthepsycho-
analytic glossaries,butwhich incertain contexts become
somewhat confusinglabels.
Theabove considerations mayserve asawarningthat itis
noteasytounderstand greatminds evenwhentheyappear
tospeak simply,orperhaps especially when their language
appears simple andtheterminologyfamiliar.

Asisshown byhiscorrespondence, Freud hadbegun working
onafirst draft ofBeyondthePleasurePrincipleinMarch, 1919,
andhereportedthedraft asfinished inthefollowing May.
During thesamemonth hewascompletinghispaper on'The
Uncanny* (1919A), which includes aparagraph setting out
much ofthegistofthepresent work inafewsentences. Inthis
paragraph herefers tothe'compulsiontorepeat'asapheno-
menon exhibited inthebehaviour ofchildren andinpsycho-
analytic treatment; hesuggests that thiscompulsionissome-
thing derived from themost intimate nature oftheinstincts;
andhedeclares that itispowerful enoughtodisregard the

pleasure principle.There is,however, noallusion tothe'death
instincts*. Headds thathehasalready completedadetailed
expositionofthesubject. Thepaper on'TheUncanny' con-
tainingthissummary waspublishedintheautumn of1919.
ButFreud heldback BeyondthePleasurePrinciple foranother
year.Intheearly partof1920hewasoncemore atworkonit,
andnow, forthe firsttimeapparently,there isareference to
the'death instincts' inaletter toEitingon ofFebruary 20.He
was stillrevisingthework inMayandJuneand itwasfinally
completed bythemiddle ofJuly,1920.OnSeptember 9,hegave
anaddress totheInternational Psycho-Analytical Congress
atTheHague, with the title'SupplementstotheTheory of
Dreams' (Ergdnzungen zurTraumlekre),inwhich heannounced
theapproaching publicationofthebook;itwasissuedearlyin
December. An'author's abstract' oftheaddress appearedin
Int.%.PsychoawL,6(1920),397-8. (Atranslation ofthiswaspub-
lished inInt.J.Psycho-Anal^ 1,354.)Itdoesnotseem certain
that thisabstract wasinfactbyFreud himself, but itmaybeof
interest toreprintithere(inanewtranslation).
'SupplementstotheTheory ofDreams9
<rThespeakerdealt inhisbrief remarks with threepoints
touching uponthetheory ofdreams. The firsttwoofthesewere
concerned with thethesis thatdreams arewish-fulfilments and
brought forward some necessary modifications ofit.The third
pointrelated tomaterial which brought complete confirmation
ofhisrejectionofthealleged "prospective" purposes ofdreams.1
"The speaker explained that, alongside thefamiliar wishful
dreams andtheanxiety dreams which couldeasily beincluded
inthetheory, thereweregroundsforrecognizingtheexistence
ofathird category,towhich hegave thename of"punishment
dreams". Ifwetook intoaccount thejustifiable assumption of
theexistence ofaspecial self-observing and critical agencyin
theego(theegoideal, thecensor, conscience),thesepunish-
ment dreams, too,should besubsumed under thetheory of
wish-fulfilment; fortheywouldrepresent thefulfilment ofa
wishonthepartofthis criticalagency. Such dreams, hesaid,
hadapproximatelythesame relation toordinarywishful dreams

EDITOR'S NOTE xix
asthesymptomsofobsessional neurosis, which arisefrom re-
action formation, hadtothose ofhysteria.
'Another classofdreams, however, seemed tothespeakerto
presentamore serious exceptiontotherulethatdreams are
wish-fulfilments. These were theso-called "traumatic" dreams.
They occur inpatients suffering fromaccidents, butthey also
occur during psycho-analyses ofneurotics andbring back to
them forgotten traumas ofchildhood. Inconnection with the
problemoffittingthese dreams intothetheory ofwish-fulfil-
ment, thespeakerreferred toaworkshortlytobepublished
under thetitleofBeyondthePleasurePrinciple.
'The thirdpoint ofthespeaker's communication related to
aninvestigationthathadnotyetbeenpublished, byDr.Varen-
donck ofGhent. Thisauthor hadsucceeded inbringing under
hisconscious observation theproduction ofunconscious phan-
tasiesonanextensive scale inahalf-sleepingstate aprocess
which hedescribed as"autisticthinking".Itappeared from
thisenquirythatlooking ahead atthepossibilities ofthenext
day,preparing attemptsatsolutions andadaptations, etc.,lay
whollywithin therangeofthispreconscious activity, which
alsocreated latentdream-thoughts, and, asthespeaker had
always maintained, hadnothingtodowiththedream-work.'x
Intheseries ofFreud'smetapsychological writings, Beyond
thePleasurePrinciple mayberegardedasintroducing thefinal
phaseofhisviews.Hehadalready drawn attention tothe

canseesignsofthenewpicture oftheanatomical structure of
themind which wastodominate allFreud's laterwritings.
Finally, theproblem ofdestructiveness, whichplayed anever
more prominent partinhistheoretical works, makes itsfirst
explicit appearance. Thederivation ofvarious elements inthe
present discussion from hisearliermetapsychological works
such as'TheTwoPrinciples ofMental Functioning' (1911),

isthecloseness withwhich some oftheearlier sections ofthe

INthetheoryofpsycho-analysis wehavenohesitation inassum-

thatthecourse ofthose events isinvariablysetinmotion byan
unpleasurable tension, andthat ittakes adirection such that
itsfinaloutcome coincides withalowering ofthattension that

thequantityofexcitation presentinitaslowaspossibleorat
least tokeepitconstant. This latterhypothesisisonlyanother
wayofstatingthepleasure principle;forifthework ofthe
mental apparatusisdirected towards keepingthequantityof
excitation low,thenanythingthat iscalculated toincrease that
quantityisbound tobefeltasadverse tothefunctioningofthe
apparatus,that isasunpleasurable. Thepleasure principle
follows from theprinciple ofconstancy: actually the latter

theimmense majorityofourmentalprocesses would have tobe
accompanied bypleasureortolead topleasure,whereas

inthemind astrong tendency towards thepleasure principle,but
thatthattendencyisopposed bycertain other forces orcircum-

Fechner (1873, 90)remarks onasimilar point: 'Since however a

andsince ingeneraltheaim isattainable onlybyapproxima-

Ifweturnnow tothequestionofwhat circumstances areable
topreventthepleasure principlefrombeing carried intoeffect,
wefindourselves oncemoreonsecure andwell-trodden ground
and,inframing ouranswer, wehave atourdisposal arichfund
ofanalytic experience.
The firstexampleofthepleasure principle being inhibited
inthiswayisafamiliar onewhich occurs withregularity. We
know thatthepleasure principleispropertoaprimary method
ofworking onthepartofthementalapparatus, butthat,from
thepointofviewoftheself-preservation oftheorganism among
thedifficulties oftheexternal world,itisfrom thevery outset
inefficient andevenhighly dangerous. Under theinfluence of
theego'sinstincts ofself-preservation,thepleasure principleis
replaced bythereality principle,1This latterprincipledoesnot
abandon theintention ofultimately obtaining pleasure, but it
nevertheless demands andcarries into effect thepostponement
ofsatisfaction, theabandonment ofanumber ofpossibilities of
gainingsatisfaction andthetemporarytoleration ofunpleasure

principle long persists, however, asthemethod ofworking em-
ployed bythesexual instincts, which aresohard to'educate*,
and, starting from thoseinstincts, orintheego itself,itoften
succeeds inovercoming thereality principle,tothedetriment of
theorganismasawhole.
There canbenodoubt, however, thatthereplacement ofthe
pleasure principle bythereality principle canonlybemade
responsibleforasmall number, andbynomeans themost
intense, ofunpleasurable experiences. Another occasion ofthe
release ofunpleasure, which occurs withnolessregularity,is
tobefound intheconflicts anddissensions thattakeplaceinthe
mentalapparatus while theegoispassing throughitsdevelop-
ment intomorehighly composite organizations. Almost allthe
energy withwhich theapparatusisfilled arises from itsinnate
instinctualimpulses. Butthese arenot allallowed toreach

aconsequenceoftheoldconflict which ended inrepression,a
newbreach hasoccurred inthepleasure principleatthevery
timewhen certain instincts were endeavouring,inaccordance
with theprinciple,toobtain freshpleasure. The details ofthe
process bywhich repressionturns apossibilityofpleasureintoa

AtthispointIproposetoleave thedarkanddismalsubject

ofworking employed bythementalapparatus inoneofits
earliest normal activities Imean inchildren'splay.
The different theories ofchildren's playhave only recently
beensummarized anddiscussed from thepsycho-analytic point
ofviewbyPfeifer(1919),towhose paperIwould refermy
readers. These theoriesattempttodiscover themotives which
leadchildren toplay,buttheyfailtobringintotheforeground
theeconomic motive, theconsideration oftheyield ofpleasure
involved. Without wishingtoinclude thewhole field covered
bythesephenomena,Ihavebeen able,through achanceop-
portunity whichpresented itself tothrow somelightupon the

that thiswasnotamere interjection butrepresented theGer-

This, then,wasthecomplete game disappearance andreturn.
Asaruleoneonly witnessed itsfirst act,which wasrepeated

greater pleasure wasattached tothesecond act.1
Theinterpretationofthegame thenbecame obvious. It
wasrelated tothechild'sgreat cultural achievement thein-
stinctual renunciation (that is,therenunciation ofinstinctual
satisfaction) which hehadmade inallowinghismother togo
away withoutprotesting. Hecompensated himself forthis, asit
were,byhimselfstagingthedisappearance andreturn ofthe
objectswithin hisreach. Itisofcourse amatter ofindifference
from thepointofview ofjudging theeffective nature ofthe
game whether thechild invented ithimself ortook itoveron
some outsidesuggestion. Our interest isdirected toanother
point.The child cannotpossibly have felthismother'sdepart-

incomprehensible.Itsoonturned out,however, thatduringthislong
period ofsolitude thechildhadfound amethod ofmaking himself dis-
appear. Hehaddiscovered hisreflection inafull-length mirror which

factthatthe first act,thatofdeparture, wasstagedasagame
initselfandfarmore frequently thantheepisodeinitsentirety,
with itspleasurable ending.
Nocertain decision canbereached from theanalysis ofa
singlecase like this.Onanunprejudiced viewonegetsanim-
pressionthatthechild turned hisexperience intoagame from
another motive. Attheoutset hewasinapassive situation he
wasoverpowered bytheexperience; but,byrepeating it,
unpleasurable thoughitwas, asagame, hetookonanactive
part.These efforts mightbeputdown toaninstinct formastery
thatwasacting independentlyofwhether thememory was
initselfpleasurableornot.But stillanotherinterpretation may
beattempted. Throwing away theobject sothat itwas'gone'
might satisfy animpulseofthechild's, which wassuppressed in
hisactual life,torevenge himself onhismother forgoingaway
from him.Inthatcase itwould have adefiant meaning: *A11
right, then, goaway!Idon't need you.I'msending youaway
myself.'Ayear later, thesameboywhom Ihadobserved athis
firstgame used totakeatoy,ifhewasangry withit,andthrow

clear thathehadnodesire tobedisturbed inhissolepossession

it,make themselves master ofthesituation. Butontheother
hand itisobvious that alltheir playisinfluenced byawish
thatdominates them thewhole time thewish tobegrown-up
andtobeable todowhatgrown-up peopledo.Itcanalsobe
observed thattheunpleasurablenature ofanexperience does

Nevertheless,itemerges from thisdiscussion 'that there isno

TWENTV-HVE yearsofintense work havehad astheir result
thattheimmediate aimsofpsycho-analytic techniquearequite
other to-daythantheywere attheoutset. Atfirsttheanalysing
physiciancould donomore than discover theunconscious
material thatwasconcealed from thepatient, putittogether,
and,attherightmoment, communicate ittohim. Psycho-
analysiswasthen firstandforemost anartofinterpreting.
Since thisdidnotsolve thetherapeutic problem,afurther aim
quicklycame inview: toobligethepatienttoconfirm the

consisted now inuncoveringthese asquicklyaspossible, in
pointingthem outtothepatientandininducing himbyhuman

But itbecame ever clearer thattheaimwhich hadbeen set
uptheaim thatwhatwasunconscious should become con-
scious isnotcompletelyattainable bythatmethod. The

andwhathecannot remember maybepreciselytheessential

with thetherapeuticsuccess that isdependent onit.
Inorder tomake iteasier tounderstand this'compulsion to

There isnodoubt thattheresistance oftheconscious and

Theearlyefflorescence ofinfantile sexual life isdoomed to
extinction because itswishes areincompatiblewithreality and
with theinadequate stage ofdevelopment which thechild has
reached. That efflorescence comes toanendinthemost dis-

Thoughthisconsideration isnotabsolutely conclusive,itnever-

AtthispointIshall venture totouch foramoment upon a
subject which would merit themost exhaustive treatment. As
aresult ofcertainpsycho-analytic discoveries, weareto-dayina
positiontoembark onadiscussion oftheKantian theorem that
timeandspaceare'necessary forms ofthought*. Wehave learnt
thatunconscious mental processes areinthemselves 'timeless*.2
Thismeans inthefirstplacethattheyarenotorderedtempor-
ally,thattime doesnotchange them inanywayandthatthe
ideaoftimecannot beappliedtothem. These arenegativechar-
acteristics which canonlybeclearly understood ifacomparison
ismade with conscious mentalprocesses. Ontheother hand, our
abstract idea oftime seems tobewholly derived from the
method ofworking ofthesystem Pcpt.-Cs. and tocorrespond to
aperception onitsownpartofthatmethod ofworking. This
mode offunctioning mayperhapsconstitute another wayof
providing ashieldagainststimuli. Iknow that these remarks
mustsound veryobscure, butImust limitmyselftothese hints.8

coming from within are,however, intheirintensity and in
other, qualitative, respectsintheiramplitude, perhaps more
commensurate with thesystem's method ofworking than the
stimuli which stream infrom theexternal world.2This state of
things producestwodefinite results. First, thefeelings ofpleasure
andunpleasure (whichareanindex towhat ishappeninginthe
interior oftheapparatus) predominate over allexternal stimuli.
And secondly,aparticular wayisadoptedofdealingwithany
internal excitations which produce toogreat anincrease of
unpleasure:there isatendencytotreatthem asthough they
were acting, notfrom theinside, butfrom theoutside, sothat

Thespecific unpleasureofphysical painisprobably the
result oftheprotectiveshield having beenbrokenthrough ina
limited area.There isthen acontinuous stream ofexcitations
from thepartoftheperiphery concerned tothecentral
apparatusofthemind, such ascould normally ariseonlyfrom
within theapparatus.1Andhow shallweexpect themind to
react tothisinvasion? Gathecticenergyissummoned from all
sides toprovide sufficiently high cathexes ofenergyinthe
environs ofthebreach. An'anticathexis' onagrandscale isset
up,forwhose benefit alltheotherpsychical systems areim-
poverished,,sothattheremaining psychical functions areexten-
sively paralysedorreduced. Wemust endeavour todraw a
lesson from examples such asthisandusethem asabasis for
ourmetapsychological speculations. From thepresent case,
then,weinfer thatasystem which isitselfhighly cathected is
capableoftaking upanadditional stream offreshinflowing
energy andofconvertingitintoquiescent cathexis., that isof

cathexis, thegreater seems tobeitsbinding force; conversely,
therefore, thelower itscathexis, thelesscapacitywill ithave for
taking upinflowing energysandthemore violent must bethe
consequencesofsuchabreach intheprotective shieldagainst
stimuli. Tothisview itcannot bejustly objected that the
increase ofcathexis round thebreach canbeexplainedfarmore
simplyasthedirect result oftheinflowing masses ofexcitation.
Ifthatwereso,thementalapparatus wouldmerelyreceive an

ofpainandtheimpoverishment ofalltheother systems would
remain unexplained. Nordothevery violent phenomena of

initschange from afreely flowing intoaquiescentstate.
Wemay,Ithink, tentatively venture toregard thecommon
traumatic neurosis asaconsequenceofanextensive breach
beingmade intheprotective'shieldagainststimuli. Thiswould
seem toreinstate theold,naivetheory ofshock, inapparent
contrast tothe later andpsychologically more ambitious
theory which attributesaetiological importancenottothe
effects ofmechanical violence buttofright andthethreat tolife.
These opposingviews arenot,however, irreconcilable; nor is
thepsycho-analytic viewofthetraumatic neurosis identical with
theshock theory initscrudest form.The latterregards the
essence oftheshock asbeing thedirectdamagetothemolecular

decisive factor indeterminingtheoutcome; though where the
strength ofatrauma exceeds acertain limit thisfactor willno
doubt cease tocarry weight. The fulfilment ofwishesis,aswe
know, broughtabout inahallucinatory manner bydreams, and
under thedominance ofthepleasure principlethishasbecome
their function. But itisnotintheservice ofthatprinciple that
thedreams ofpatients suffering from traumatic neuroses lead
them back withsuchregularitytothesituation inwhich the
trauma occurred. Wemay assume, rather, thatdreams are
herehelpingtocarry outanother task,which mustbeaccom-
plishedbefore thedominance ofthepleasure principlecaneven
begin. These dreams areendeavouringtomaster thestimulus
retrospectively, bydevelopingtheanxiety whose omission was
thecause ofthetraumatic neurosis. They thusafford usaview
ofafunction ofthementalapparatus which, thoughitdoesnot
contradict thepleasure principle,isnevertheless independent of
itandseems tobemoreprimitive than thepurpose ofgaining
pleasureandavoiding unpleasure.
Thiswould seem tobetheplace, then, atwhich toadmit for
thefirsttimeanexceptiontothepropositionthatdreams are
fulfilments ofwishes. Anxiety dreams, asIhave shown
repeatedly and indetail, offernosuch exception. Nordo

Thiswould imply nodenial oftheir later function. But ifonce

Ihave argued elsewhere*that'war neuroses'(insofar

The fact towhich Ihave referred onpage 6,thatagross

secondly,thatpainful andfeverish illnesses exercise apowerful
effect, solongasthey last,onthedistribution oflibido. Thus, on
theonehand, themechanical violence ofthetrauma would
liberate aquantityofsexual excitation which, owingtothelack
ofpreparationforanxiety, would have atraumatic effect; but,
ontheother hand, thesimultaneous physical injury, bycalling

bind theexcess ofexcitation. Itisalsowellknown, thoughthe

restoration ofanearlier stateofthings.Itfollows thatthepheno

what hasleft itsmarkonthedevelopment oforganisms must be
thehistoryoftheearthweliveinandofitsrelation tothesun.
Every modification which isthusimposed upon thecourse oi
theorganism'slife isaccepted bytheconservativeorganic
instincts andstored upforfurtherrepetition. Those instincts are
therefore bound togiveadeceptive appearance ofbeing forces
tending towards change andprogress, whilst infactthey are

must beanoldstate ofthings, aninitial statefromwhich the

itisstrivingtoreturn bythecircuitouspaths along which its

tothatwhich latercaused thedevelopmentofconsciousness ina

arose inwhathadhitherto beenaninanimate substance endeav-
oured tocancel itself out.Inthiswaythefirstinstinct came into
being: theinstinct toreturn totheinanimate state. Itwas still
aneasymatter atthattime foraliving substance todie;the
course ofitslifewasprobably onlyabrief one,whose direction
wasdetermined bythechemical structure oftheyounglife.
Foralong time, perhaps, living substance wasthusbeing con-
stantly created afresh andeasily dying,tilldecisive external

oflifeand tomake evermore complicateddetours before
reachingitsaimofdeath. These circuitouspathstodeath, faith-
fullykepttobytheconservative instincts, would thuspresent
usto-daywith thepicture ofthephenomenaoflife.Ifwe
firmly maintain theexclusively conservative nature ofinstincts,
wecannot arrive atanyother notions astotheorigin andaim
oflife.
Theimplicationsinregardtothegreat groupsofinstincts
which, aswebelieve, liebehind thephenomenaoflifein
organisms mustappear nolessbewildering. Thehypothesisof
self-preservative instincts, such asweattribute toallliving
beings,stands inmarkedoppositiontotheideathatinstinctual
lifeasawhole serves tobring about death. Seen inthislight,
thetheoreticalimportanceoftheinstincts ofself-preservation,
ofself-assertion andofmastery greatlydiminishes. Theyare
componentinstincts whose function itistoassure that the
organismshall follow itsownpathtodeath, andtoward off
anypossible waysofreturningtoinorganicexistence other than
thosewhich areimmanent intheorganismitself.Wehaveno
longer toreckon withtheorganism's puzzling determination (so
hard tofitintoanycontext)tomaintain itsownexistence inthe
faceofeveryobstacle. Whatweareleftwith isthefactthatthe
organism wishes todieonly initsown fashion. Thus these
guardians oflife,too,wereoriginallythemyrmidonsofdeath.
Hence arises theparadoxicalsituation thattheliving organism
struggles mostenergetically againstevents(dangers,infact)
which might helpittoattain itslife'saimrapidly byakindof
short-circuit. Such behaviour is,however, preciselywhat char-
acterizespurelyinstinctual ascontrasted with intelligent
efforts.1
But letuspauseforamoment and reflect. Itcannot beso.
Thesexual instincts, towhich thetheoryoftheneuroses gives
aquite special place, appearunder averydifferentaspect.
Theexternalpressure which provokesaconstantly increasing

andplants, are,indeed, living to-day. Inthesameway,thewhole
pathofdevelopmenttonatural death isnottrodden byallthe
elementaryentities which composethecomplicated body ofone
ofthehigher organisms. Some ofthem, thegerm-cells, probably
retain theoriginalstructure ofliving matter and, afteracertain
time, with their fullcomplementofinherited andfreshly
acquiredinstinctualdispositions, separate themselves from the
organismasawhole. These twocharacteristics maybeprecisely
what enables them tohaveanindependentexistence. Under
favourable conditions, theybegintodevelopthatis,torepeat
theperformancetowhich theyowe their existence; andinthe
endonce again oneportionoftheir substancepursuesits
developmenttoafinish, while anotherportion harks backonce
againasafresh residual germtothebeginningoftheprocess
ofdevelopment. These germ-cells, therefore, workagainst the
death oftheliving substance andsucceed inwinningfor it
whatwecanonlyregardaspotential immortality, though that
maymean nomore than alengthening oftheroad todeath.
Wemust regardasinthehighest degree significant thefact
that thisfunction ofthegerm-cellisreinforced, oronlymade

The instincts which watch overthedestinies ofthese elemen-
taryorganisms thatsurvive thewhole individual, whichprovide
them withasafeshelter while they aredefencelessagainst the
stimuli oftheexternal world, whichbring about theirmeeting
withothergerm-cells, andsoonthese constitute thegroup of
thesexual instincts. They areconservative inthesame sense
astheother instincts inthattheybring back earlier states of
living substance; buttheyareconservative toahigher degree
inthattheyarepeculiarlyresistant toexternal influences; and
theyareconservative tooinanother sense inthattheypreserve
lifeitself foracomparatively long period.1They arethetrue
lifeinstincts. They operate against thepurposeoftheother
instincts, whichleads,byreason oftheir function, todeath; and
thisfactindicates thatthere isanopposition between themand
theother instincts, anopposition whoseimportance waslong
agorecognized bythetheory oftheneuroses. Itisasthoughthe

lifeoftheorganism moved withavacillating rhythm. One
groupofinstincts rushes forward soastoreach thefinalaim
oflifeasswiftlyaspossible;butwhen aparticular stageinthe
advance hasbeen reached, theother group jerks back toa
certain pointtomake afresh startandsoprolongthejourney.
Andeventhoughitiscertain thatsexuality andthedistinction
between thesexes didnotexistwhen lifebegan,thepossibility
remains thattheinstincts which were later tobedescribed as

maynotbetruethat itwasonlyatalatertime thattheystarted
upontheirwork ofopposingtheactivities ofthe'ego-instincts'.1
Letusnowharkback foramoment ourselves andconsider
whether there isanybasis atallforthesespeculations.Isit
really thecase that, apartfromthesexual instinctsfthere areno
instincts thatdonotseek torestore anearlier state ofthings?
thatthere arenone thataimatastateofthings which hasnever
yetbeen attained? Iknow ofnocertain example from the
organic world thatwould contradict thecharacterization Ihave
thusproposed. There isunquestionably nouniversal instinct
towards higher development observable intheanimal orplant
world, eventhoughitisundeniable thatdevelopmentdoes in
factoccur inthat direction. Butontheonehand itisoften
merely amatter ofopinion whenwedeclare thatonestage of
developmentishigher than another, andontheotherhand
biology teaches usthathigher developmentinonerespectis
very frequently balanced oroutweighed byinvolution in
another. Moreover there areplentyofanimal forms fromwhose
early stages wecaninfer that theirdevelopment has,onthe
contrary, assumed aretrograde character. Bothhigher develop-
mentandinvolution mightwellbetheconsequencesofadapta-
tiontothepressureofexternal forces; andinboth cases the
partplayed byinstincts might belimited totheretention(in
theform ofaninternal source ofpleasure) ofanobligatory
modification.3

Letusturn back, then, tooneoftheassumptionsthatwe

however, that this belief intheinternalnecessity ofdyingis
onlyanother ofthose illusions which wehave created 'urn die
Schwere desDaseins zuertragen'.'1Itiscertainly notaprimaeval
belief. Thenotion of'natural death' isquite foreigntoprimi-
tiveraces; they attribute every death thatoccurs among them
totheinfluence ofanenemy orofanevilspirit.Wemust
therefore turn tobiologyinorder totestthevalidity ofthe
belief.
Ifwedoso,wemaybeastonished tofindhow littleagree-
ment there isamong biologists onthesubjectofnatural death
andinfactthatthewholeconcept ofdeath meltsaway under
their hands. The factthatthere isafixedaverage duration of
lifeatleastamongthehigher animalsnaturally arguesinfavour
oftherebeing suchathingasdeath from natural causes. But
thisimpressioniscountered whenweconsider thatcertainlarge
animals and certaingigantic arborealgrowths reach avery
advancedageandonewhich cannot atpresent becomputed.
Accordingtothelarge conception ofWilhelm Fliess[1906],all
thephenomena oflifeexhibited byorganism and also,no
doubt, their death arelinked with thecompletion offixed
periods, whichexpressthedependence oftwokinds ofliving
substance(onemaleandtheotherfemale) upon thesolaryear.When wesee,however, howeasily andhowextensivelythe

appearance ofvitalphenomena (especiallyintheplant world)

upontherigidity ofFliess's formulas oratleastupon whether

Thegreatestinterest attaches fromourpointofview tothe
treatment giventothesubjectoftheduration oflifeandthe
death oforganismsinthewritings ofWeismann(1882, 1884,
1892, etc.)Itwashewho introduced thedivision ofliving
substance intomortal andimmortalparts.Themortal partis

thebody inthenarrower sense the'soma' which alone is
subjecttonatural death. Thegerm-cells, ontheother hand, are
potentially immortal, insofarasthey areable,under certain
favourable conditions, todevelopintoanewindividual, or,in
other words, tosurround themselves withanewsoma.(Weis-
mann, 1884,)
What strikes usinthis istheunexpected analogy withour
own view, which wasarrived atalong suchadifferentpath.
Weismann, regarding livingsubstancemorphologically,seesin
itoneportionwhich isdestined todie thesoma, thebody
apartfrom thesubstance concerned with sexandinheritance
andanimmortalportionthegerm-plasm, which isconcerned
with thesurvival ofthespecies, withreproduction. We,onthe
other hand, dealingnotwiththelivingsubstance butwith the
forcesoperatinginit,havebeen ledtodistinguish twokinds of
instincts: thosewhich seektoleadwhat islivingtodeath, and
others, thesexual instincts, which areperpetually attempting
andachieving arenewal oflife.Thissounds likeadynamic
corollary toWeismann'smorphological theory.
Buttheappearance ofasignificant correspondenceisdis-
sipatedassoon aswediscover Weismann's viewsontheproblem
ofdeath. Forheonlyrelates thedistinction between themortal
somaandtheimmortalgerm-plasmtomulticellularorganisms;in
unicellular organismstheindividual andthereproductivecell
are stilloneandthesame(Weismann, 1882, 38).Thus hecon-
siders thatunicellular organisms arepotentially immortal, and
thatdeath onlymakes itsappearancewith themulticellular
metazoa. Itistruethat thisdeath ofthehigher organismsisa
natural one,adeath from internal causes; but itisnotfounded
onanyprimal characteristic ofliving substance (Weismann,
1884, 84)andcannot beregardedasanabsolutenecessity with
itsbasis intheverynature oflife(Weismann, 1882, 33).Death
israther amatter ofexpediency,amanifestation ofadaptation
totheexternal conditions oflife; for,when once thecellsofthe
body havebeen divided intosomaandgerm-plasm, anun-
limited duration ofindividual lifewould become aquite point-
lessluxury. When thisdifferentiation hadbeenmade inthe
multicellularorganisms, death becamepossible andexpedient.
Since then, thesoma ofthehigher organisms hasdied atfixed
periodsforinternalreasons, while theprotista haveremained
immortal. Itisnotthecase,ontheother hand, thatreproduc-
BEYOND THEPLEASURE PRINCIPLE 41
tionwasonlyintroduced atthesame time asdeath.Onthe
contrary,itisaprimalcharacteristic ofliving matter, like
growth (from which itoriginated), and lifehasbeencontinuous
from itsfirstbeginning uponearth. (Weismann, 1884,84f.)
Itwillbeseen atonce thattoconcede inthiswaythathigher
organismshaveanatural death isofverylittlehelp tous.For
ifdeath isalateacquisition oforganisms, then there canbe
noquestionofthere having been death instincts from thevery
beginningoflifeonthisearth. Multicellular organisms maydie
forinternal reasons, owingtodefective differentiation orto
imperfectionsintheir metabolism, butthematter isofno
interest from thepointofview ofourproblem. Anaccount of
theoriginofdeath such asthis ismoreover farlessatvariance
withourhabitual modes ofthought than thestrange assumption
of*death instincts'.
Thediscussion which followed uponWeismann'ssuggestions
led,sofarasIcansee,tonoconclusive results inanydirection.1
Some writers returned totheviews ofGoette(1883), who re-
garded death asadirect result ofreproduction. Hartmann
(1906, 29)doesnotregardtheappearanceofa*dead body* a
dead portionoftheliving substance asthecriterion ofdeath,
butdefines death as'thetermination ofindividualdevelop-
ment*. Inthissenseprotozoatooaremortal; intheir casedeath
alwayscoincides withreproduction, but istosome extent
obscured byit,since thewhole substance oftheparent animal
maybetransmitted directly intotheyoung offspring.
Soon afterwards research wasdirected totheexperimental
testing onunicellular organisms ofthealleged immortality
oflivingsubstance. AnAmericanbiologist, Woodruff, experi-
menting with aciliate infusorian, the*slipper-animalcules
,
whichreproduces byfission intotwoindividuals, persisteduntil
the3029th generation (atwhichpoint hebroke offtheexperi-
ment), isolating oneofthepart-products oneach occasion and
placingitinfresh water. Thisremote descendent ofthe first
slipper-animalcule wasjustaslivelyasitsancestor andshowed
nosigns ofageing ordegeneration. Thus, insofarasfigures of
thiskindprove anything,theimmortalityoftheprotista seemed
tobeexperimentally demonstrable.2
Otherexperimentersarrived atdifferent results. Maupas,
iCf.Hartmann(1906), Lipschiitz (1914) andDoflein (1919).
For thisandwhat follows seeLipschiitz (1914, 26and52fF.).

Calkins andothers, incontrast toWoodruff, found that after a
certain number ofdivisions these infusoria becomeweaker,
diminish insize, suffer thelossofsomepartoftheirorganization
andeventually die, unless certainrecuperative measures are
appliedtothem. Ifthis isso,protozoa wouldappeartodie

completely contradicting Weismann's assertion thatdeath isa

Atthispointthequestion may well arise inourminds
whether anyobject whatever isserved bytryingtosolve the
problemofnatural death from astudy oftheprotozoa. The
primitive organizationofthese creatures mayconceal fromour
eyesimportantconditions which, thoughinfactpresentinthem
too,onlybecome visible inhigher animals where theyareable to
findmorphological expression. And ifweabandon themorpho-
logical pointofviewandadoptthedynamic one,itbecomes a
matter ofcompleteindifference touswhether natural death
canbeshown tooccur inprotozoa ornot.Thesubstance which
islater recognizedasbeing immortal hasnotyetbecome
separatedinthemfrom themortal one.The instinctual forces
which seektoconduct lifeintodeathmay alsobeoperatingin
protozoafrom thefirst,andyettheir effects maybesocom-
pletelyconcealed bythelife-preservingforces that itmaybe
veryhard tofindanydirect evidence oftheirpresence. Wehave
seen, moreover, thattheobservations made bybiologists allow
ustoassume thatinternalprocesses ofthiskindleadingtodeath
dooccur alsoinprotista. Buteven ifprotista turned outtobe
immortal inWeismann's sense, hisassertion thatdeath isalate
acquisition would apply onlytoitsmanifest phenomena and
would notmakeimpossible theassumption ofprocesses tending
towards it.
Thus ourexpectationthatbiology wouldflatly contradict the
recognition ofdeath instincts hasnotbeen fulfilled. Weareat
libertytocontinue concerningourselves with theirpossibility,
ifwehave other reasons fordoingso.Thestriking similarity
between Weismann*s distinction ofsomaandgerm-plasm and
ourseparation ofthedeath instincts from the lifeinstincts
persists andretains itssignificance.Wemaypauseforamoment over thispre-eminentlydualistic
view ofinstinctual life.AccordingtoE.Hering's theory, two
kinds ofprocessesareconstantly atwork inliving substance,
operatingincontrary directions, oneconstructive orassimi-
latory andtheother destructive ordissimilatory. Maywe
venture torecognizeinthesetwodirections taken bythevital
processes theactivity ofourtwoinstinctual impulses,the life

Letusmake aboldattemptatanotherstepforward. Itis
generallyconsidered that theunion ofanumber ofcells into
avital association themulticellular character oforganisms-
hasbecome ameans ofprolongingtheir life.One cellhelps to
preservethe lifeofanother, andthecommunity ofcellscan
survive even ifindividual cellshave todie.Wehavealready
heard thatconjugation, too,thetemporary coalescence oftwo
unicellular organisms, hasalife-preserving andrejuvenating
effectonbothofthem. Accordingly, wemight attempttoapply
thelibido theory which hasbeen arrived atinpsycho-analysis to
themutual relationship ofcells.Wemight suppose thatthe life
instincts orsexual instincts which areactive ineach celltakethe
other cells astheirobject,thatthey partly,neutralize thedeath
instincts(that is,theprocessessetupbythem)inthose cells
andthuspreservetheirlife;while theother cellsdothesame for
them,and stillothers sacrifice themselves intheperformanceof
thislibidinal function. Thegerm-cellsthemselves would behave
inacompletely'narcissistic* fashion tousethephrasethatwe
areaccustomed touseinthetheory oftheneuroses todescribe
awhole individual who retains hislibido inhisegoandpays
none ofitoutinobject-cathexes. Thegerm-cells requiretheir
libido, theactivity oftheir lifeinstincts, forthemselves, asa
reserve againsttheir latermomentous constructiveactivity.
(Thecells ofthemalignant neoplasmswhichdestroy the
organism should alsoperhaps bedescribed asnarcissistic inthis
same sense: pathologyispreparedtoregardtheir germsas
innate andtoascribe embryonicattributes tothem.)2Inthisway
thelibido ofoursexual instincts would coincide withtheEros of
thepoetsandphilosophers which holds allliving things together.
Here then isanopportunityforlooking back over theslow
developmentofourlibidotheory. Inthe firstinstance the
analysis ofthetransference neuroses forced upon ournotice the
opposition between the'sexual instincts', which aredirected
towards anobject, andcertain other instincts, withwhich we
were very insufficiently acquainted andwhich wedescribed

provisionallyasthe'ego-instincts'.1Aforemostplaceamong
these wasnecessarily given totheinstinctsserving the self-
preservationoftheindividual. Itwasimpossibletosaywhat
other distinctions were tobedrawn among them.Noknow-
ledge would have beenmore valuable asafoundation for
truepsychologicalscience thananapproximate grasp ofthe
common characteristics andpossible distinctive features ofthe
instincts. Butinnoregion ofpsychology werewegroping more
inthedark.Everyone assumed theexistence ofasmany instincts
or'basic instincts' ashechose, andjuggled withthem likethe
ancient Greek naturalphilosophers with their fourelements
earth, air, fireandwater.Psycho-analysis, which could not
escape making someassumption about theinstincts, keptatfirst
tothepopulardivision ofinstinctstypified inthephrase 'hunger
arid love'.Atleast therewasnothing arbitrary inthis;andby
itshelptheanalysis ofthepsychoneuroses wascarried forward
quiteadistance. Theconcept of'sexuality1
,andatthesame
timeofthesexual instinct, had,itistrue, tobeextended soas
tocovermany things which could notbeclassed under the
reproductive function; and thiscaused nolittlehubbub inan
austere, respectable ormerely hypocritical world.

seeing minds had,itistrue, longsinceobjectedtotheconcept
oflibidobeingrestricted totheenergy ofthesexual instincts
directed towards anobject. Buttheyfailed toexplain howthey
had arrived attheir better knowledge ortoderive from it
anythingofwhichanalysis couldmake use.Advancing more
cautiously, psycho-analysis observed theregularity withwhich
libido iswithdrawn from theobject anddirected ontotheego
(the processofintroversion); and,bystudyingthelibidinal
development ofchildren initsearliestphases, came tothecon-
clusion thattheegoisthetrueandOriginalreservoir oflibido,8

andthat itisonlyfrom thatreservoir that libido isextended on
toobjects. The egonowfound itsposition among sexual
objects andwasatoncegiven theforemost placeamong them.
Libido which wasinthiswaylodged intheegowasdescribed
asNarcissistic*.1This narcissistic libido wasofcourse alsoa
manifestation oftheforce ofthesexual instinct intheanalytical
senseofthose words, and ithadnecessarily tobeidentified with
the'self-preservativeinstincts' whose existence hadbeenrecog-
nized from the first.Thus theoriginal opposition between the
ego-instincts andthesexual instincts provedtobeinadequate.Aportion oftheego-instincts wasseen tobelibidinal; sexual
instinctsprobably alongside othersoperated intheego.
Nevertheless wearejustified insayingthat theoldformula
whichlaysitdown thatpsychoneuroses arebased onaconflict
betweenego-instincts andsexual instincts containsnothing that
weneedreject to-day.Itismerely thatthedistinction between
thetwokinds ofinstinct, which wasoriginally regarded asin

ently namelyasbeing topographical. And inparticularitisstill
true that thetransferenceneuroses, theessentialsubject of
psycho-analytic study, aretheresult ofaconflict between the
egoandthelibidinal cathexis ofobjects.
But itisallthemorenecessaryforustolaystressupon the
libidinal character oftheself-preservative instincts nowthatwe
areventuring uponthefurtherstepofrecognizing thesexual
instinct asEros, thepreserver ofallthings, andofderiving the
narcissistic libido oftheegofrom thestores oflibido bymeans
ofwhich thecellsofthesoma areattached tooneanother. Butwenow findourselvessuddenly facedbyanotherquestion. If
theself-preservative instincts tooareofalibidinalnature, are
thereperhaps noother instincts whatever butthelibidinal ones?
Atallevents there arenone other visible. Butinthatcasewe
shall after allbedriven toagree with thecriticswhosuspectedfromthefirstthatpsycho-analysis explains everything bysexuality,orwith innovators likeJung who,making ahasty judgement,haveused theword 'libido' tomean instinctual force ingeneral.Must notthisbeso?
Itwasnotour intention atallevents toproduce sucharesult.Ourargument hadasitspoint ofdeparture asharp distinction

andsexual instincts, which weequated with lifeinstincts. (We
werepreparedatonestage [p.33]toinclude theso-called self-
preservativeinstincts oftheegoamongthedeathinstincts; but
wesubsequently [p.46]corrected ourselves onthispointand
withdrew it.)Ourviews havefrom theveryfirstbeen dualistict
andto-day theyareevenmoredefinitely dualistic than before
nowthatwedescribe theoppositionasbeing, notbetweenego-
instincts andsexual instincts butbetween lifeinstincts and
death instincts. Jung'slibidotheoryisonthecontrary monistic;
thefactthathehascalled hisoneinstinctual force *libido* is
bound tocause confusion, butneednotaffect usotherwise.1We
suspectthat instincts other than those ofself-preservation oper-
ateintheego,and itoughttobepossibleforustopoint tothem.
Unfortunately, however, theanalysis oftheegohasmade solittle
headwaythat itisverydifficult forustodoso.Itispossible,in-
deed, thatthelibidinal instincts intheegomaybelinked ina
peculiarmanner2with these otherego-instincts which are still
strangetous.Even before wehadanyclearunderstanding of
narcissism, psycho-analysts hadasuspicion thatthe'ego-in-
stincts' hadlibidinal components attached tothem. Butthese are
veryuncertainpossibilities,towhich ouropponentswillpayvery
little attention. The difficulty remains thatpsycho-analysis has
notenabled ushitherto topointtoany[ego-]instincts other than
thelibidinal ones. That, however, isnoreason forourfallingin
with theconclusion thatnoothers infact exist.

Let us,however, return totheself-preservative sexual in-

aconclusivereplytothisquestion. The result isbrought about
bytheinflux offreshamounts ofstimulus. This tallies wellwith
thehypothesisthatthe lifeprocess oftheindividual leads for
internal reasons toanabolition ofchemical tensions, that isto
say,todeath, whereas union with theliving substance ofa
different individual increases those tensions, introducing what
maybedescribed asfresh 'vital differences* which must then

itselfwith thebiological concept (assumed ontheoretical grounds) ofan
impetus towards death. SeealsoRank (1907).Allthese discussions, like

oftheliving substance inthehigher organisms.
Inother words, weneedmore information ontheorigin of

Thequestionarises here, asinthecaseofdeath[p.43],whether

which they actually exhibit, andwhether itiscorrect toassume
that forces andprocesseswhich become visibleonlyinthe

that itpostulatestheexistence oflifeinstincts already operating

works counter tothecourse oflifeandmakes thetaskofceasing
tolivemore difficult, would notberetained andelaborated but
would beavoided. If,therefore, wearenottoabandon the
hypothesisofdeath instincts, wemust suppose them tobe
associated from theveryfirstwith lifeinstincts. But itmust be
admitted thatinthatcaseweshallbeworking uponanequation

closely with reproduction. With thehypothesis ofnarcissistic libidoand
theextension oftheconcept oflibido totheindividualcells, thesexual
instinct wastransformed forusintoEros,which seeks toforce together
andholdtogether theportions ofliving substance. What arecommonly
called thesexual instincts arelooked uponbyusasthepartofEros

which isdirected towards objects. Ourspeculations have suggested that
Eros operates from thebeginning oflifeandappearsasa*Jife instinct*
inoppositiontothe*death instinct* which wasbrought intobeing by
thecoming tolifeofinorganic substance. These speculations seek to
solve theriddle oflifebysupposing that thesetwoinstincts were strug-
glingwitheachotherfrom theveryfirst. [Added 1921:]Itisnotsoeasy,
perhaps,tofollow thetransformations through which theconcept ofthe
*ego-instincts*haspassed. Tobegin withweapplied thatname toall
theinstinctual trends (ofwhich wehadnocloser knowledge) which
could bedistinguished from thesexual instincts directed towards an
object; andweopposed theego-instincts tothesexual instincts ofwhich
thelibido isthemanifestation.Subsequently wecame tocloser grips
with theanalysis oftheegoandrecognized thataportion ofthe'ego-
instincts1isalsoofaHbidinal character andhastaken thesubject's own
egoasitsobject. These narcissisticself^preservativeinstincts hadthence-
forward tobecounted among theiibidinal sexual instincts. Theoppo-
sition between theego-instincts andthesexual instincts wastransformed
intoonebetween theego-instincts andtheobject-instincts, both ofa
Iibidinal nature. Butinitsplaceafresh opposition appeared between the
Iibidinal (ego-andobject-) instincts andothers, which mustbepresumed
tobepresent intheegoandwhichmayperhaps actually beobserved
inthedestructive instincts. Our speculations have transformed this
oppositionintoonebetween the lifeinstincts (Eros) andthedeath
instincts.

IFitisreallythecasethatseekingtorestore anearlier stateof
thingsissuchauniversal characteristic ofinstincts, weneed not
besurprisedthat somany processestakeplaceinmental life
independentlyofthepleasure principle.This characteristic
would beshared byallthecomponentinstincts andintheir
casewould aimatreturning oncemore toaparticular stage in
thecourse ofdevelopment.These arematters overwhich the
pleasure principlehasasyetnocontrol; but itdoesnotfollow
thatanyofthem arenecessarily opposedtoit,andwehave still
tosolve theproblemoftherelation oftheinstinctualprocesses
ofrepetitiontothedominance ofthepleasure principle.Wehavefound thatoneoftheearliest andmostimportant
functions ofthementalapparatusistobind theinstinctual
impulseswhich impinge onit,toreplacetheprimary pro-
cessprevailinginthembythesecondary process andconvert
theirfreelymobile cathectic energyintoamainly quiescent
(tonic)cathexis. While thistransformation istaking place no
attention canbepaidtothedevelopmentofunpleasure; but
thisdoesnotimplythesuspensionofthepleasure principle.
Onthecontrary, thetransformation occurs onbehalf ofthe
pleasure principle;thebindingisapreparatoryactwhich
introduces andassures thedominance ofthepleasure principle.
Letusmake asharperdistinction thanwehave hitherto
made between function andtendency. Thepleasure principle,
then,isatendency operatingintheservice ofafunction whose
business itistofreethementalapparatus entirely from excita-
tionortokeeptheamount ofexcitation initconstant orto
keepitaslowaspossible. Wecannotyetdecide withcertainty
infavour ofanyofthesewaysofputting it;but itisclear that
thefunction thusdescribed would beconcerned with themost
universal endeavour ofallliving substance namelytoreturn
tothequiescence oftheinorganic world.Wehave allexperi-
encedhow thegreatest pleasure attainable byus,thatofthe
sexual act,isassociated withamomentaryextinction ofahighly
intensified excitation. Thebinding ofaninstinctualimpulse
would beapreliminary functiondesignedtopreparetheexcita-
tion foritsfinal elimination inthepleasureofdischarge.
56
BEYOND THEPLEASURE PRINCIPLE 57
This raises thequestion ofwhetherfeelings ofpleasure and
unpleasurecanbeproduced equally frombound andfrom
unbound excitatory processes. And there seems tobenodoubt
whatever thattheunbound orprimary processes giverisetofar
more intensefeelingsinboth directions than thebound or
secondary ones.Moreover theprimary processes aretheearlier
intime; atthebeginning ofmental lifethere arenoothers, and
wemayinfer that ifthepleasure principle hadnotalready been
operativeinthem itcould never havebeen established forthe
later ones.Wethusreach what isatbottom novery simple
conclusion, namely that atthebeginning ofmental lifethe
struggleforpleasure wasfarmore intense than laterbutnotso
unrestricted: ithadtosubmit tofrequent interruptions. Inlater
times thedominance ofthepleasure principleisverymuch
more secure, but ititself hasnomoreescaped theprocess of
taming than theother instincts ingeneral. Inanycase,what-
ever itisthatcauses theappearance offeelings ofpleasure and
unpleasureinprocesses ofexcitation must bepresentinthe
secondary process justasitisintheprimary one.
Heremight bethestarting-pointforfreshinvestigations. Our
consciousness communicates tousfeelings from within notonly
ofpleasure andunpleasure butalsoofapeculiar tension which
initsturncanbeeitherpleasurable orunpleasurable. Should
thedifference between thesefeelings enable ustodistinguish
between bound and"unboundprocessesofenergy? oristhe
feeling oftension toberelated totheabsolutemagnitude, or
perhapstothe level, ofthecathexis, while thepleasure and
unpleasure series indicates achange inthemagnitude ofthe
cathexis within agivenunitoftime?*Anotherstrikingfact isthat
the lifeinstincts have somuch more contact withourinternal
perception emergingasbreakers ofthepeace andconstantly
producing tensions whose release isfeltaspleasure while the
death instincts seem todotheirworkunobtrusively. The
pleasure principle seemsactuallytoserve thedeath instincts.
Itistruethat itkeeps watch uponstimuli from without, which
areregardedasdangers byboth kinds ofinstincts; but itis
moreespecially onguard againstincreases ofstimulation from
within, which would make thetaskofliving more difficult.
This inturn raises ahostofotherquestionstowhichwecanat
