Moreover, the

elucidation of the mere facts of the problem may

be expected to deepen our insight into the
situation with which they are concerned.

The man Moses, the liberator of his people, who
gave them their religion and their laws, belonged
to an age so remote that the preliminary question
arises whether he was an historical person or a
legendary figure. If he lived, his time was the
thirteenth or fourteenth century B.C.; we have
no word of him but from the Holy Books and
the written traditions of the Jews. Although
the decision lacks final historical certainty, the
great majority of historians have expressed the
opinion that Moses did live and that the exodus

from Egypt, led by him, did in fact take place.

What first attracts our interest in the person of

Moses is his name, which is written Mosche in
Hebrew. One may well ask: Where does it
come from ? What does it mean ? As is well

known, the story in Exodus, Chapter ii, already
answers this question. There we learn that the
Egyptian princess who saved the babe from the
waters of the Nile gave him his name, adding the
etymological explanation: because I drew him
out of the water. But this explanation is obviously

On the other hand the suggestion has long been
made and by many different people that the name
Moses derives from the Egyptian vocabulary.
Instead of citing all the authors who have voiced
this opinion I shall quote a passage from a recent
work by Breasted, 1 an author whose History of

a convenient rapid form for the cumbrous full

citing related names should have passed over the
analogous theophorous names in the list of

Egyptian kings, such as Ah-mose, Thut-mose
(Thothmes) and Ra-mose (Ramses).
It might have been expected that one of the
many authors who recognized Moses to be an
Egyptian name would have drawn the conor at least considered the possibility,
that the bearer of an Egyptian name was himself
clusion,

an Egyptian. In modern times we have no
misgiving in drawing such conclusions, although
to-day a person bears two names, not one, and
although a change of name or assimilation of it
in new conditions cannot be ruled out. So we
are not at all surprised to find that the poet
Chamisso was of French extraction, Napoleon
Buonaparte on the other hand of Italian, and
that Benjamin Disraeli was an Italian Jew as
his name would lead us to expect. And such an
inference from the name to the race should be

more reliable and indeed conclusive in respect
of early and primitive times. Nevertheless to the
best of my knowledge no historian has drawn this
conclusion in the case of Moses, not even one of
those who, like Breasted, are ready to suppose

seemed
monstrous to imagine that the man Moses could
have been anything other than a Hebrew. In
any event, what happened was that the recognition of the name being Egyptian was not a factor
in judging the origin of the man Moses, and that
nothing further was deduced from it. If the

considered important, then any new material for

This is what my little essay attempts. It may
claim a place in Imago 1 because the contribution
brings is an application of psycho-analysis.
The considerations thus reached will impress only
it

that minority of readers familiar with analytical

reasoning and able to appreciate its conclusions.
To them I hope it will appear of significance.

In 1909 Otto Rank, then still under my influence, published at my suggestion a book entitled
Der Mythus von der Geburt des Helden. 2 It deals with

"
In consequence the father (or a

person

representing him) gives orders for the new-born
babe to be killed or exposed to extreme danger;
in most cases the babe is placed in a casket and

The child is then saved by animals or poor

such as shepherds, and suckled by a

The most remote of the historical personages
to whom this myth attaches is Sargon of Agade,
the founder of Babylon about 2800 B.C. From the
point of view of what interests us here it would
perhaps be worth while to reproduce the account
ascribed to himself:

not drown me, but carried me to Akki, the

the goodness of his heart lifted me out of the

The best known names in the series beginning
with Sargon of Agade are Moses, Cyrus and
Romulus. But besides these Rank has enumerated

many other heroes belonging to myth or poetry

to

with a few short hints.

A hero is a man who stands up manfully against
his father and in the

end victoriously overcomes

him. The myth
question traces this struggle
back to the very dawn of the hero's life, by having

him born against his father's will and saved in
spite of his father's evil intentions. The exposure
in the basket is clearly a symbolical representation of birth ;

the basket is the womb, the stream

the water at birth.

In innumerable dreams the

relation of the child to the parents is represented

by drawing or saving from the water.

When the

imagination of a people attaches this myth to a
famous personage it is to indicate that he is
recognized as a hero, that his life has conformed
to the typical plan. The inner source of the myth

But for that purpose it was entirely unfitted;

was really born and in which he was brought up.

The other is fictitious, invented by the myth in
pursuance of its own motives. As a rule the real
family corresponds with the humble one, the
noble family with the fictitious one. In the case

of Moses something seemed to be different.

And

here the new point of view may perhaps bring

some illumination. It is that the first family,
the one from which the babe is exposed to danger,
is

in all comparable cases the fictitious one;

the

second family, however, by which the hero is
adopted and in which he grows up is his real one.
If we have the courage to accept this statement
as a general truth to which the Moses legend also
is subject, then we suddenly see our way clear.
Moses is an Egyptian probably of noble origin
whom the myth undertakes to transform into a
Jew. And that would be our conclusion! The

MOSES AN EGYPTIAN

23

exposure in the water was in its right place; to
fit the new conclusion the intention had to be
changed, not without violence. From a means of
getting rid of the child it becomes a means of its
salvation.

The divergence of the Moses legend from all
others of its kind might be traced back to a
special feature in the story of Moses life. Whereas

in close connection with this the possible motivation of numerous characteristics and peculiarities

people can be perceived. It stimulates ideas of
some moment concerning the origin of monotheistic religion in general. But such important
considerations cannot be based on psychological
probabilities alone. Even if one were to accept it

probability,

however seductive, can protect us
even if all parts of a problem seem

from error;

to fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle,

one has to remember that the probable need not
necessarily be the truth and the truth not always
probable. And, lastly, it is not attractive to be
classed with the scholastics

and talmudists who

are satisfied to exercise their ingenuity unconcerned how far removed their conclusions may

be from the truth.
Notwithstanding these misgivings, which weigh
as heavily to-day as they did then, out of the
conflict of my motives the decision has emerged
to follow up

my first essay by this contribution.

But once again it is only a part of the whole, and
not the most important part.

If,

then, Moses was an Egyptian, the first gain

from this suggestion is a new riddle, one difficult
to answer. When a people of a tribe 1 prepares
for a great undertaking it is to be expected that
one of them should make himself their leader or
be chosen for this role. But what could have
induced a distinguished Egyptian perhaps a
prince, priest or high official

IF

31

the head of a throng of culturally inferior immigrants,

and to leave the country with them, is

not easy to conjecture.

The well-known contempt

of the Egyptians for foreigners makes such a
proceeding especially unlikely. Indeed, I am
inclined to think this is why even those historians
recognized the name as Egyptian, and
ascribed all the wisdom of Egypt to him, were not

who

willing to entertain the obvious possibility that

Moses was an Egyptian.
This first difficulty is followed by a second. We
must not forget that Moses was not only the
political leader of the Jews settled in Egypt, he
was also their law -giver and educator and the

man who forced them to adopt a new religion,
which is still to-day called Mosaic after him.
But can a single person create a new religion so
easily ? And when someone wishes to influence
the religion of another would not the most
natural thing be to convert him to his own ?
The Jewish people in Egypt were certainly
not without some kind of religion, and if
Moses, who gave them a new religion, was an
Egyptian, then the surmise cannot be rejected
that this other new religion was the Egyptian
one.

This possibility encounters an obstacle: the
sharp contrast between the Jewish religion

Moses and the Egyptian one.
The former is a grandiosely rigid monotheism.

life of the Egyptians.

Some of these differences may easily derive
from the contrast in principle between a strict
monotheism and an unlimited polytheism. Others
are obviously consequences of a difference in
intellectual level; one religion is very near to the
primitive, the other has soared to the heights of
sublime abstraction. Perhaps it is these two

much, is contrasted with the way in which the
making of the image of any living or visionary
being is bluntly forbidden.
There is yet another difference between the

two religions, which the explanations we have
attempted do not touch. No other people of
antiquity has done so much to deny death, has
made such careful provision for an after-life; in
accordance with this the death -god Osiris, the
ruler of that other world, was the mosj; popular
and indisputable of all Egyptian gods.^The early
Jewish religion, on the other hand, had entirely

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

34

relinquished immortality; the possibility of an
existence after death was never mentioned in any
place.

And this is all the more remarkable since

A strange fact in the history of the Egyptian

opens up another point of view.
It is still possible that the religion Moses gave to
his Jewish people was yet his own, an Egyptian
religion though not the Egyptian one.
In the glorious Eighteenth Dynasty, when
Egypt became for the first time a world power,
a young Pharaoh ascended the throne about
relatively late,

375 B.C., who first called himself Amenhotep (IV)
like his father, but later on changed his name
and not only his name. This king undertook

under Amenhotep III, the father and predecessor
of the reformer, the worship of the Sun God was
in the ascendant, probably in opposition to the

worship of Amon of Thebes, who had become
over prominent. An ancient name of the Sun-

God Aton or Atum was rediscovered, and in this
Aton religion the young king found a movement
he had no need to create, but one which he could
join.
Political conditions in

Egypt had about that
time begun to exert a lasting influence on
Egyptian religion. Through the victorious sword
of the great conqueror Thothmes III Egypt had
become a world power. Nubia in the south,
Palestine, Syria and a part of Mesopotamia in
the north had been added to the Empire. This
imperialism was reflected in religion as Universality and Monotheism. Since Pharaoh's solicitude
now extended beyond Egypt to Nubia and Syria,
Deity itself had to give up its national limitation
and the new God of the Egyptians had to become
the unique and unlimited sovereign

Amenhotep never denied his accession to the
Sun Cult of On. In the two hymns to Aton, which
have been preserved to us through the inscriptions
in the rock tombs and were probably composed
by him, he praises the sun as the creator and
preserver of

astonishing anticipation of scientific knowledge
concerning the effect of sunlight. There is no

doubt that he went further: that he worshipped
the sun not as a material object, but as a symbol
of a Divine Being whose energy was manifested
in his rays. 1

But we do scant justice to the king if we see in
him only the adherent and protector of an Aton
religion which had already existed before him.
His activity was much more energetic. He added

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

There would be a short way of proving our
thesis that the Mosaic religion is nothing else
but that of Aton, namely, by a confession of
faith, a proclamation. But I am afraid I should
be told that such a road is impracticable. The
"

Schema
Jewish creed, as is well known, says:
Jisroel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echod." If the
similarity of the name of the Egyptian Aton (or
Atum) to the Hebrew word Adonai and the

Syrian divine name Adonis is not a mere accident,
but is the result of a primaeval unity in language

and meaning, then one could translate the
Jewish formula: Hear, oh Israel, our god Aton
(Adonai) is the only God. I am, alas, entirely
unqualified to answer this question and have
been able to find very little about it in the
literature concerned, 1 but probably we had
better not make things so simple.

Moreover, we

The points of similarity as well as those of
difference in the two religions are easily discerned,

but do not enlighten us much. Both are forms of
a strict monotheism, and we shall be inclined to
reduce to this basic character what is similar in
both of them. 'Jewish monotheism is in some

to the Aton religion and surmise that this feature

was taken over from the latter, since for Ikhnaton
it was a necessity in fighting the popular religion

greater part than any god of the upper regions.
The agreement of the Jewish religion with that of

Aton in this important point is the first strong

from the wrath of God by speedily performing
the operation. These are distortions, however,

their motives presently. The fact remains that
the question concerning the origin of circumcision

has only one answer: it comes from Egypt.

the custom of circumcision had long been
practised in Egypt, and his statement has been
confirmed by the examination of mummies and

even by drawings on the walls of graves. No

as far as we know followed this custom; we can
assume with certainty that the Semites, Babylonians and Sumerians were not circumcised.

The possibility that the

Jews in Egypt adopted the usage of circumcision
in any other way than in connection with the
religion Moses gave them may be rejected as
quite untenable. Now let us bear in mind that
circumcision was practised in Egypt by the

people as a general custom, and let us adopt for
the moment the usual assumption that Moses was

from and the suggestion we added to it are so
incompatible with each other that we venture to

law of circumcision, he was no Jew but an
Egyptian, and then the Mosaic religion was

with which the Jewish one shows agreement in
some remarkable points.

As I remarked earlier, my hypothesis that
Moses was not a Jew but an Egyptian creates a

new enigma. What he did easily understandable if he were a Jew becomes unintelligible in
an Egyptian. But if we place Moses in Ikhnaton's
period and associate him with that Pharaoh,
then the enigma is resolved and a possible motive
presents itself, answering all our questions. Let
us assume that Moses was a noble and distin-

perhaps indeed a member of the
royal house, as the myth has it. He must have
been conscious of his great abilities, ambitious
and energetic; perhaps he saw himself in a dim
future as the leader of his people, the governor
of the Empire. In close contact with Pharaoh he
was a convinced adherent of the new religion,
whose basic principles he fully understood and
had made his own. With the king's death and
the subsequent reaction he saw all his hopes and
prospects destroyed. If he was not to recant the

and there was then no central power that could
have prevented it.
According to our construction the Exodus from
Egypt would have taken place between 1358 and
1350, that is to say, after the death of Ikhnaton

and before the restitution of the authority of the
state by Haremhab. 1 The goal of the wandering
could only be Canaan. After the supremacy of
Egypt had collapsed, hordes of war -like Arameans
had flooded the country, conquering and pillaging, and thus had shown where a capable people
could seize new land.

The motivation that we have surmised for the

circumcision. We know in what manner human

ancient custom, scarcely any longer understood. Those who do not practise it regard it as

very odd and find it rather abhorrent; but those
who have adopted circumcision are proud of the
custom. They feel superior, ennobled, and look
down with contempt at the others, who appear
to them unclean. Even to-day the Turk hurls
abuse at the Christian by calling him "an uncircumcised dog.

Jewish tradition, however, behaved later on as
if it were oppressed by the sequence of ideas we
have just developed. To admit that circumcision
was an Egyptian custom introduced by Moses
would be almost to recognize that the religion
handed down to them from Moses was also
Egyptian. But the Jews had good reasons to
deny this fact; therefore the truth about circumcision had also to be contradicted.

Some of my own

continue the discussion. The kernel of our thesis,
the dependence of Jewish monotheism on the
monotheistic episode in Egyptian history, has

been guessed and hinted at by several workers.
I need not cite them here, since none of them has
been able to say by what means this influence
was exerted. Even if, as I suggest, it is bound up
with the individuality of Moses, we shall have
to weigh other possibilities than the one here
preferred. It is not to be supposed that the overthrow of the official Aton religion completely
put an end to the monotheistic trend in Egypt.
The School of Priests at On, from which it
emanated, survived the catastrophe and might
have drawn whole generations after Ikhnaton

That
Moses performed the deed is quite thinkable,
therefore, even if he did not live in Ikhnaton's
time and had not come under his personal
influence, even if he were simply an adherent or
merely a member of the school of On. This

we had gained into

Moses motives and to dispense with the idea of

prevailing in Egypt.

The kings of the Nineteenth

Dynasty following Ikhnaton ruled the country
with a strong hand. All conditions, internal and
external, favouring the

Exodus coincide only in

the period immediately after the death of the
heretic king.

The Jews possess a rich extra -biblical literature
where the myths and superstitions are to be found
which in the course of centuries were woven
around the gigantic figure of their first leader and
the founder of their religion and which have both
hallowed and obscured that figure. Some fragments of sound tradition which had found no
place in the Pentateuch may lie scattered in that
material. One of these legends describes in an
attractive fashion

how the ambition of the man

Moses had already displayed itself in his childhood. When Pharaoh took him into his arms and
playfully tossed him high, the little three-yearold snatched the crown from Pharaoh's head and

placed it on his own. The king was startled at
this omen and took care to consult his sages. 1

The same anecdote, slightly altered, is to be found in Josephus.

Then, again, we are told of victorious battles he
fought as an Egyptian captain in Ethiopia and,
in the same connection, that he fled the country
because he had reason to fear the envy of a
faction at court or even the envy of Pharaoh
himself. The Biblical story itself lends Moses
certain features in which one is inclined to believe.

These modern historians, well represented by
E. Meyer/ follow the Biblical text in one decisive
point. They concur that the Jewish tribes, who
later on become the people of Israel, at a certain
time accepted a new religion. But this event did
not take place in Egypt nor at the foot of a
mount in the Sinai peninsula, but in a place
called Meribat-Qades, an oasis distinguished by
its abundance of springs and wells in the country
south of Palestine between the eastern end of the
Sinai peninsula and the western end of Arabia.
There they took over the worship of a god Jahve,
probably from the Arabic tribe of Midianites who
lived near-by. Presumably other neighbouring
tribes were also followers of that god.

Jahve was certainly a volcano god. As we know,
however, Egypt has no volcanoes and the
mountains of the Sinai peninsula have never
been volcanic; on the other hand, volcanoes
which may have been active up to a late period
are found along the western border of Arabia.
One of these mountains must have been the

We cannot escape the impression that this
Moses of Qades and Midian, to whom tradition
could even ascribe the erection of a brazen serpent
as a healing god, is quite a different person from
the august Egyptian we had deduced, who disclosed to his people a religion in which all magic

and sorcery were most strictly abhorred. Our
Egyptian Moses differs perhaps no less from the
Midian Moses than the universal god Aton
differed from the demon Jahve on his divine
mountain.

And if we concede any measure of

truth to the information furnished

by modern

historians, then we have to admit that the thread

we wished to draw from the surmise that Moses
was an Egyptian has broken off for the second
time; this time, so it seems, without any hope
of its being tied again.

E. Meyer by Gressmann and others. In 1922
E. Sellin made a discovery of decisive importance. 1

He found in the book of the prophet Hosea

unmistakable
traces of a tradition to the effect that the founder
of their religion (Moses) met a violent end in a
rebellion of his stubborn and refractory people.
The religion he had instituted was at the same

one writer: the different names are a distinct

sign of originally different gods.
We admitted the adherence to the custom of
circumcision as evidence that at the founding of
the new religion at Qades a compromise had
taken place. What it consisted in we learn from
both J and E; the two accounts coincide and
must therefore go back to a common source,
either a written source or an oral tradition. The
guiding purpose was to prove the greatness and
power of the new god Jahve. Since the Moses
people attached such great importance to their
experience of the Exodus from Egypt, the deed of
freeing them had to be ascribed to Jahve; it had
to be adorned with features that proved the
terrific grandeur of this volcano god, such as, for
example, the pillar of smoke which changed to
one of fire by night, or the storm that parted the
waters so that the pursuers were drowned by the

returning floods of water. The Exodus and the
founding of the new religion were thus brought
close together in time, the long interval between

them being denied.

The bestowal of the Ten

Commandments too was said to have taken place,
not at Qades, but at the foot of the Holy Mountain amidst the signs of a volcanic eruption. This
description, however, did a serious wrong to the

memory of the man Moses; it was he, and not
the volcano god, who had freed his people from
Egypt. Some compensation was therefore due to
him, and it was given by transposing Moses to

Qades or to the mount Sinai -Horeb and putting

him in the place of the Midianite priest. We shall

IF

MOSES WAS AN EGYPTIAN

The distorting tendencies we want to detect
must have influenced the traditions before they
were written down. One of them, perhaps the
strongest of all, we have already discovered. We
said that when the new god Jahve in Qades was
instituted something had to be done to glorify
him. It is truer to say: He had to be established,
made room for; traces of former religions had to
be extinguished. This seems to have been done
successfully with the religion of the settled tribes ;

no more was heard of it. With the returning
tribes the task was not so easy; they were determined not to be deprived of the Exodus from
Egypt, the man Moses and the custom of circumcision. It is true they had been in Egypt, but they
had left it again, and from now on every trace of
Egyptian influence was to be denied. Moses was
disposed of by displacing him to Midian and
Qades and making him into one person with the
priest who founded the Jahve religion. Circumthe most compromising sign of the
cision,
dependence on Egypt, had to be retained, but, in
spite of all the existing evidence, every endeavour
was made to divorce this custom from Egypt.
The enigmatic passage in Exodus, written in an
almost incomprehensible style, saying that God
had been wroth with Moses for neglecting circumcision and that his Midianite wife saved his
life

by a speedy operation, can be interpreted

only as a deliberate contradiction of the significant

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

72
truth.

We shall soon come across another inven-

tion for the purpose of invalidating a piece of

inconvenient evidence.
It is hardly to be described as a new tendency
it is

only the continuation of the same one

when we find an endeavour completely to deny
that Jahve was a new god, one alien to the Jews.
For that purpose the myths of the patriarchs,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are drawn upon.
Jahve maintains that He had been the God of
those patriarchs; it is true and He has to admit
this Himself they did not worship Him under
this name. 1
He does not add under what other name He used
to be worshipped. Here the opportunity was taken
to deal a decisive blow at the Egyptian origin of
the custom of circumcision. Jahve was said to have
already demanded it from Abraham, to have
instituted it as sign of the bond between him and
Abraham's descendants. This, however, was a

to use a sign to distinguish someone from other
people, one would choose something that the
others did not possess certainly not something
that millions could show. An Israelite, finding

himself in Egypt, would have had to recognize
all Egyptians as brothers, bound by the same bond,
brothers in Jahve.

The fact that circumcision

was native to the Egyptians could not possibly have been unknown to the Israelites who

Otherwise the feeling of the people might have
taken exception -justifiably so to the behaviour
of a deity who makes a covenant with his patriarchs containing mutual obligations, and then

they are one from the beginning. Sometimes, it
is true, we hear of a people adopting another god,

but never of a god choosing a new people.

Knossos was also the result of an earthquake. In Crete, as
probably everywhere in the ^Sgean world, the great Mother
Goddess was then worshipped. The observation that she was
unable to guard her house against the attack of a stronger power

The motive is not clearly visible;

perhaps they did not want to be reminded of the
influence of Midian. But all later distortions,
especially those of the Priestly Code, serve another
aim. There was no longer any need to alter in a
particular direction descriptions of happenings of
long ago; that had long been done. On the
other hand, an endeavour was made to date
back to an early time certain laws and institutions of the present, to base them as a rule on the
Mosaic law and to derive from this their claim to

and binding force. However much the
picture of past times in this way became falsified,

the procedure does not lack a certain psychological justification. It reflected the fact that in

the course of many centuries

about 800 years

had elapsed between the Exodus and the fixation
of the Biblical text by Ezra and Nehemiah the
religion of Jahve had followed a retrograde
development that had culminated in a fusion
(perhaps to the point of actual identity) with the
original religion of Moses.

And this is the essential outcome:

Among all the events of Jewish prehistory that
poets, priests and historians of a later age undertook to portray there was an outstanding one the

suppression of which was called for by the most
obvious and best of human motives. It was the

murder of the great leader and liberator Moses,
which Sellin divined from clues furnished by the
presumption cannot be called
fanciful; it is probable enough. Moses, trained
in Ikhnaton's school, employed the same methods
as the king; he gave commands and forced his

religion on the people.
Perhaps Moses doctrine
was still more uncompromising than that of his
Master; he had no need to retain any connection
with the religion of the Sun God since the school
of On would have no importance for his alien
people. Moses met with the same fate as Ikhnaton,

The Jewish people of Moses was quite as unable
to bear such a highly spiritualized religion, to
find in what it offered satisfaction for their needs,
as were the Egyptians of the Eighteenth Dynasty.

The people's falling away from the new religion
is also mentioned in the text, though as a mere
episode. It is the story of the golden calf, where
by an adroit turn the breaking of the tables of the
law which has to be understood symbolically
(= "he has broken the law ") is ascribed
to Moses himself and imputed to his angry
indignation.

There came a time when the people regretted

me an idle one. There was no Pharaoh at that
time, because the Exodus happened during the
interregnum. But the Merneptah stele does not
throw any light on the possible date of the fusion

to cool down after the murder of Moses and for
the influence of the Moses people, the Levites, to

Qades presupposes. Two generations, sixty years,
might suffice, but only just. The date inferred
from the stele of Merneptah falls too early, and
as we know that in our hypothesis one assumption
only rests on another we have to admit that this
discussion shows a weak spot in the construction.
Unfortunately everything connected with the
settling of the Jewish people in Canaan is highly

The Historical Premisses

The historical background of the events which
have aroused our interest is as follows. Through
the conquests of the Eighteenth Dynasty Egypt
had become a world Empire. The new Imperialism was reflected in the development of
certain religious ideas, if not in those of the whole
people, yet in those of the governing and inUnder the

and perhaps the purest, of a monotheistic religion.
A deeper knowledge of the historical and psychological conditions of its origin would be of
inestimable value. Care was taken, however,
that not much information concerning the Aton
religion should come down to us. Already under
the reign of Ikhnaton's weak successors everything
he had created broke down.

but an episode, doomed to be forgotten.
This is what has been established historically
and at this point our work of hypothesis begins.
Among the intimates of Ikhnaton was a man who

was perhaps called Thothrnes, as so many others
were at that time; l the name does not matter,
but its second part must have been -mose. He
held high rank, and was a convinced adherent of
the Aton religion, but in contradistinction to the
brooding King he was forceful and passionate.
For this man the death of Ikhnaton and the
abolishing of his religion meant the end of all his
hopes. Only proscribed or recanting could he
remain in Egypt. If he were governor of a border
province he might well have come into touch with
a certain Semitic tribe which had immigrated
several generations ago. In his disappointment
and loneliness he turned to those strangers and

sought in them for a compensation of what he
had lost. He chose them for his people and tried
to realize his own ideals through them. After he

immediate followers he hallowed them by the
custom of circumcision, gave them laws and
introduced them to the Aton religion which the
Egyptians had just discarded. Perhaps the rules
the man Moses imposed on his Jews were even
harder than those of his master and teacher
Ikhnaton; perhaps he also relinquished the
connection with the Sun God of On, to whom the
latter had still adhered.

For the Exodus from Egypt we must fix the
time of the interregnum after 1350. The subsequent periods of time, until possession was
taken of the land of Canaan, are especially
obscure. Out of the darkness which the Biblical

had done before them. The second fact, proved
by E. Meyer, is that these Jews on their return

a fertile spot called Qades, they accepted under

however, that the name Israel does not yet refer
to the tribes whose fate we are here following and
that in reality we have a longer period at our
disposal. The settling of the later Jewish people
in Canaan was certainly not a swiftly achieved
conquest; it was rather a series of successive
struggles and must have stretched over a longish
period.

turn and their empires destroyed.

In three important points the later Jewish God
became identical with the old Mosaic God. The
first and decisive point is that he was really
recognized as the only God, beside whom another

god was unthinkable. Ikhnaton's monotheism
was taken seriously by an entire people; indeed,
this people clung to it to such an extent that it
became the principal content of their intellectual
life and displaced all other interests. The people
and the priesthood, now the dominating part of
it, were unanimous on that point; but the priests,
in confining their activities to elaborating the
ceremonial for his worship, found themselves in

opposition to strong tendencies within the people
which endeavoured to revive two other doctrines

of Moses about his God.

sacrifice

It is time now to raise the question whether
there is any need at all to invoke Moses' influence

on the final shape of the Jewish idea of their
God, whether it is not enough to assume a
spontaneous development to a higher spirituality
during a cultural life extending over many

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 105

centuries.

On this possible explanation, which

would put an end to all our guessing, I would
make two comments. First that it does not explain
anything. The same conditions did not lead to
monotheism with the Greek people, who were
surely most gifted, but to a breaking up of polytheistic religion and to the beginning of philo-

a great world empire. With the Jews the political
conditions were most unfavourable for a development away from the idea of an exclusive national
God towards that of an universal ruler of the
world. Whence then did this tiny and impotent
reflection of a

nation derive the audacity to pass themselves off
for the favourite child of the Sovereign

Lord ?

The question of the origin of monotheism among
the Jews would thus remain unanswered or else

one would have to be content with the current
answer that it was the expression of their particular religious genius.

later times, are declared to be Mosaic laws, with

the clear intention of enhancing their authority.

This is certainly a reason for suspicion, yet hardly

enough for us to use. For the deeper motive of
such an exaggeration is clear as daylight. The
priests, in the

accounts they present, desired to

establish a continuity

between their own times

and the Mosaic period. They attempted to deny
just that which we have recognized to be the
most striking feature of Jewish religious history,
namely, that there was a gap between the
Mosaic law -giving and the later Jewish religion
a gap filled in at first by the worship of Jahve and
only later slowly covered over. Their presentation denies this sequence of events with all the

means in its power, although its historical correctness is beyond all doubt, since throughout the

peculiar treatment the Biblical Text has undergone there remain more than enough statements
in proof of it. The priests' version had an aim
similar to that of the tendency which made the

new god Jahve the God of the Patriarchs.

If we

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 107

take into consideration this motive of the Priestly

Code it is hard not to believe that it was really
Moses who gave his Jews the monotheistic idea.

was soon codified in writing; the people from
Egypt had brought with them the art of writing
and the fondness for writing history. A long
time was to elapse, however, before historians
came to develop an ideal of objective truth. At
they shaped their accounts according to
their needs and tendencies of the moment, with

an easy conscience, as if they had not yet understood what falsification signified. In consequence,
a difference began to develop between the
written version and the oral report, i.e. the
tradition, of the same subject-matter. What has
been deleted or altered in the written version
might quite well have been preserved uninjured
in the tradition. Tradition was the complement
and at the same time the contradiction of the
written history. It was less subject to distorting
influences perhaps in part entirely free of them
and therefore might be more truthful than the
account set down in writing.

Its trustworthiness,

however, was impaired by being vaguer and more
fluid than the written text, being exposed to many

changes and distortions as it was passed on from
one generation to the other by word of mouth.
Such a tradition may have different outcomes.
The most likely event would be for it to be

vanquished by the written version, ousted by it,
until it grows more and more shadowy and at last
is forgotten.
Another fate might be that the
tradition itself ends by becoming a written

which if made earlier would surely

have been considered too bold.

It has discovered

the evidence of the grandiose Minoan -Mycenaean

an end on the Greek mainland by 1250 B.C.
The Greek historians of a later period hardly
ever refer to it. There is the remark that there
was a time when the Cretans ruled the sea, a
mention of the name of King Minos and his
palace, and of the labyrinth; but that is all.
Nothing remained of that great time but the
culture which

traditions seized upon by the great writers.

Other peoples also possess such folk-epics, for
example, the Indians, Finns and Germans. It
is for the literary historian to investigate whether
the same conditions as with the Greeks applied
there as well.

I

think that such an investigation

would yield a positive result. The conditions we

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 115

have specified for the origin of folk-epics are as
follows

:

there exists a period of early history that

immediately afterwards is regarded as eventful,
significant, grandiose and perhaps always heroic;
yet it happened so long ago and belonged to times
so remote that later generations receive intelligence of it only as an obscure and incomplete
tradition. Surprise has been expressed that the
epic as a literary form should have disappeared
in later times. The explanation may be that the
conditions for the production of epics no longer

This analogy is met with in psychopathology,

in a discipline belonging to individual psychology,

whereas religious phenomena must of course be
regarded as a part of mass psychology. We shall
see that this analogy is not so startling as it
appears at first sight; indeed, it is rather in the
nature of an axiom.

The impressions we experienced at an early age
and forgot later, to which I have ascribed such
great importance for the aetiology of the neuroses,
are called traumata. It may remain an open

question whether the aetiology of the neuroses
should in general be regarded as a traumatic one.

The obvious objection is that a trauma is not

In this connection, however, two points stand

produces a trauma whereas with another it does
not. We then have the conception of a sliding

useful to group together the facts relating to the

important analogy in question. They are as
follows. Our researches have shown that what
we call the phenomena or symptoms of a neurosis
are the consequences of certain experiences and
impressions which, for this very reason, we recognize to be aetiological traumata. We wish to
ascertain, even if only in a rough schematic way,

the characteristics common to these experiences
and to neurotic symptoms.

Let us first consider the former. All these
traumata belong to early childhood, the period
up to about five years. Impressions during the
time when the child begins to speak are found to
be especially interesting. The period between two

sexual factor should

must take this into account.
These three points early happenings within
the first five years of life, the forgetting, and the
characteristic of sexuality and aggressivity
belong closely together. The traumata are either
bodily experiences or perceptions, especially those
heard or seen; that is to say, they are either
experiences or impressions. What connects the
three points is established theoretically, by
analytic work; this alone can yield a knowledge

The theory is confirmed by anatomical

study of the growth of the internal genitalia;
it suggests that man is derived from a species of

animal that was sexually mature at five years,

and arouses the suspicion that the postponement,
and the beginning twice over, of sexual life has
much to do with the transition to humanity.

Man seems to be the only animal with a latency
period and delayed sexuality.

Investigations of

primates, which so far as I know have not been
made, would furnish an invaluable test for this
theory. It must be significant psychologically
that the period of infantile amnesia coincides

with this early blossoming of sexuality. Perhaps
this state of affairs is a necessary condition for the
existence of neurosis, which seems to be a human
privilege, and which in this light appears to be
a survival from primaeval
parts of our body.

typical. The illness may also be regarded as an

bedroom had ample, and even regular, opportunity for observing sexual intercourse at an age
before he was able to talk. He saw much and
heard still more. In his later neurosis, which
broke out immediately after the time of his first
seminal emission, disturbed sleep was the earliest
and most trying symptom. He became extraordinarily sensitive to nocturnal noises and, if

once awakened, could not get to sleep again.
This disturbance was a true compromise symptom: on the one hand the expression of his
defence against his nocturnal observations, on

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 127

the other hand the endeavour to re-establish the

wakefulness which had enabled him to listen to
those experiences.
Stirred

early to aggressive virility by these
observations the boy began to excite his penis by

touch and to make sexual advances towards his
mother, putting himself thus in his father's place
through identification with him. This went on
until at last his mother forbade him to touch his
penis and threatened to tell his father, who would
take the offending organ away. This threat of
castration had a very strong traumatic effect on
the boy.

He relinquished his sexual activity and

underwent a change. Instead of
identifying himself with his father he began to be

went as far as injuring his own interests, was the

I have already upheld this thesis a quarter of a

century ago, in my book Totem and Taboo (1912),
and need only repeat what I said there. The
argument started from some remarks by Charles
Darwin and embraced a suggestion of Atkinson's.
It says that in primaeval times

men lived in small

hordes, each under the domination of a strong
male. When this was is not known; no point of
contact with geological data has been established.

own horde as well as perhaps also those

robbed from other hordes. The fate of the sons
was a hard one; if they excited the father's
jealousy they were killed or castrated or driven
out. They were forced to live in small communities and to provide themselves with wives
by robbing them from others. Then one or the
other son might succeed in attaining a situation
similar to that of the father in the original horde.

The essential point is, however, that we attribute
to those primaeval people the

same feelings and

emotions that we have elucidated in the primitives
of our own times, our children, by psychoanalytic research. That is to say they not merely
:

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

132

hated and feared their father, but also honoured
him as an example to follow; in fact each son
wanted to place himself in his father's position.

The cannibalistic act thus becomes comprehensible as an attempt to assure one's identification
with the father by incorporating a part of him.
It is

a reasonable surmise that after the killing

of the father a time followed when the brothers

quarrelled among themselves for the succession,
which each of them wanted to obtain for himself
alone.

They came to see that these fights were

as dangerous as they were futile.

This hard-won

understanding as well as the memory of the
deed of liberation they had achieved together

and the attachment that had grown up among
them during the time of their exile led at last
to a union among them, a sort of social contract.

A

strong animal, which perhaps at first was also
dreaded, was found as a substitute. Such a

choice may seem very strange to us, but the gulf

which man created later between himself and the
animals did not exist for primitive man. Nor does
it with our children, whose animal phobias we
have been able to explain as dread of the father.
The relationship to the totem animal retained
original ambivalency of feeling towards
the father. The totem was, on the one hand, the

the

corporeal ancestor and protecting spirit of the
clan; he was to be revered and protected. On
the other hand, a festival was instituted on which

day the same fate was meted out to him as the
primaeval father had encountered. He was killed
and eaten by all the brothers together. (The

according to Robertson Smith.)
This great day was in reality a feast of triumph to

Where, in this connection, does religion come
in ? Totemism, with its worship of a father substitute, the ambivalency towards the father which
is evidenced by the totem feast, the institution

of which is punished by death this totemism,

from the very beginning of time between social
institutions and moral obligations. The further
development of religion can be treated here only
in a very summary fashion. Without a doubt it
proceeded parallel to the cultural development
of mankind and the changes in the structure of

human social institutions.
The next step forward from totemism is the
humanizing of the worshipped being. Human

During that time a great social revolution had
taken place. Matriarchy was followed by a
restitution of the patriarchal order. The new
fathers, it is true, never succeeded to the omni-

potence of the primaeval father. There were too

being limited, in order to compensate the
dethroned mothers. The male gods appear at
first as sons by the side of the great mothers; only

do they clearly assume the features of the
father. These male gods of polytheism mirror the
conditions of patriarchal times. They are numerous, they have to share their authority, and

of the evidence that has gone to make up this
reconstruction. Large portions of the past, which
are here woven into a whole, are historically

as matriarchal right, totemism and male communities. Others have survived in remarkable

It seems that a growing feeling

of guiltiness had seized the Jewish people

and

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 139

perhaps the whole of civilization of that timeas a precursor of the return of the repressed
material. This went on until a member of the
Jewish people, in the guise of a political -religious
agitator, founded a doctrine which together with
another one, the Christian religion separated
from the Jewish one. Paul, a Roman Jew from
Tarsus, seized upon this feeling of guilt and
correctly traced it back to its primaeval source.

believer incorporates the flesh and blood of the

ambivalency dominating the father -son relationship, however, shows clearly in the final result
of the religious innovation.

In certain respects the new religion was a
cultural regression as compared with the older

Jewish religion; this happens regularly when a
new mass of people of a lower cultural level
effects an invasion or is admitted into an older
culture. Christian religion did not keep to the
lofty heights of spirituality to which the Jewish
religion had soared. The former was no longer

The great deed

and misdeed of primaeval times, the murder of the
Father, was brought home to the Jews, for fate
decreed that they should repeat it on the person
of Moses, an eminent father substitute. It was
a case of acting instead of remembering, something which often happens during analytic work
with neurotics. They responded to the doctrine

It can scarcely be chance that the violent

death of another great man should become the
starting point for the creation of a new religion

by Paul. This was a man whom a small number
of adherents in Judea believed to be the Son of
God and the promised Messiah, and who later
on took over some of the childhood history that
had been attached to Moses. In reality, however,

an indispensable part of our reasoning, an important link between the forgotten deed of primaeval
times and its subsequent reappearance in the
form of Monotheistic religions, 2 It is an attractive
suggestion that the guilt attached to the murder
of Moses may have been the stimulus for the wishphantasy of the Messiah, who was to return and
give to his people salvation and the promised
sovereignty over the world. If Moses was this
first Messiah, Christ became his substitute and
successor.

accusations with which antisemitism

pursues the descendants of the Jewish people are

based on such good foundations. There must, of
course, be more than one reason for a phenomenon
of such intensity and lasting strength as the
popular hatred of Jews. A whole series of reasons
can be divined: some of them, which need no
interpretation, arise from obvious considerations;
others lie deeper and spring from secret sources,
which one would regard as the specific motives.
In the first group the most fallacious is the
reproach of their being foreigners, since in many

of Cologne, where Jews came with the Romans,
before it was colonized by Germanic tribes. Other

grounds for antisemitism are stronger, as for
example, the circumstance that Jews mostly live
as a minority among other peoples, since the
feeling of solidarity of the masses in order to be
complete has need of an animosity against an
outside minority and the numerical weakness of
the minority invites suppression.

The hatred for Judaism is at bottom hatred

for Christianity, and it is not surprising that in the

German National-Socialist revolution this close
connection of the two monotheistic religions finds
such clear expression in the hostile treatment of
both.

Difficulties

Perhaps the preceding chapter has succeeded
in establishing the analogy between neurotic
processes and religious events and thereby in
pointing to the unexpected origin of the latter.
In this translation from individual into mass
psychology two difficulties emerge, different in
nature and importance, which we must now
examine. The first is that we have treated here of
only one case in the rich phenomenology of the
religions and have not thrown any light on the
others.

The author regretfully has to admit that

he cannot give more than one sample, that he has
not the expert knowledge necessary to complete
the investigation.
This limited knowledge will
allow him perhaps to add that the founding of the

Mohammedan religion seems to him to be an

then we can interpret this only as a withering in
the development of religion, and from here draw
a parallel with the innumerable cases of rudiment-

Why here as well as there no further development

took place we do not understand.

We must hold

the individual gifts of these peoples responsible

general social condition. Besides it is a good

The second difficulty in this translation into

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

150

mass psychology is much more significant, because
presents a new problem of a cardinal nature.
The question arises in what form is the active

There is no such question with individuals, for

Let us go back to our historical example. The
compromise in Qades, we said, was based on the

existence

of a

tradition

living on in the people who had returned from
Egypt. There is no problem here. We suggested
that such a tradition was maintained by conscious
memory of oral communications which had been
passed on from forbears of only two or three
generations ago. The latter had been participants
and eye-witnesses of the events in question. Can

According to Sellin, the
tradition of the murder of Moses was always

down in writing which alone made it possible
for Sellin to divine it. Yet it could not have been
known to many; it was not general knowledge.

hold that the concordance between the individual
and the mass is in this point almost complete.
The masses, too, retain an impression of the past
in unconscious memory traces.

The case of the individual seems to be clear
enough. The memory trace of early events he
has retained, but he has retained it in a special
psychological condition.

Thus the recent material gets strengthened by the

In none of the three cases does the material
that had been repressed succeed in reaching
consciousness unimpeded or without change. It
must always undergo distortions which bear witness
to the not entirely overcome resistance derived

from the counter-cathexis, or else to the modifying influence of a recent experience or to both.

the discovery of these differences that has guided

The repressed material must be regarded as
belonging to the Id and obeys its mechanisms;
it differs from it only in respect of its genesis.
This differentiation takes place during the early
period, while the Ego is developing out of the Id.

the doubt arose whether these reactions with all

be rejected; the fact of this similarity does not
enrich our knowledge of the archaic heritage.

Meanwhile analytic research has yielded several

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 159

Analytic research, however, has also brought
to light other things, which exceed in significance
anything we have so far discussed. In studying
reactions to early traumata we often find to our
surprise that they do not keep strictly to

what the

individual himself has experienced, but deviate
from this in a way that would accord much better

with their being reactions to genetic events and
in general can be explained only through the
influence of such. The behaviour of a neurotic
child to his parents when under the influence of

an (Edipus and castration complex is very rich
in such reactions which seem unreasonable in the
individual and can only be understood phylogenetically, in relation to the experiences of
earlier generations. It would be amply worth

my remarks are based. In fact it seems to me

of a national character, it is such an inherited

Or at least I did

not distinguish between the two, and was not
quite clear about what a bold step I took by
neglecting this difference.

This state of affairs is

made more difficult, it is true, by the present
attitude of biological science

which rejects the

idea of acquired qualities being transmitted to
descendants. I admit, in all modesty, that in

admit that for the memory-traces in our archaic

than those remnants of memory evoked by

second question I would remark: there may be
a number of influences which need not all be
known; a spontaneous course is also possible in
analogy with what happens in some neuroses.

The awakening, however, of the memory-trace
through a recent real repetition of the event is
certainly of decisive importance. The murder of
Moses was such a repetition, and later on the
supposed judicial murder of Christ, so that these
events move into the foreground as causative
agents. It seems as if the genesis of monotheism
would not have been possible without these
events.

We are reminded of the words of the

poet:

left to the reader's free will whether he wishes to
linger with a subject or return to it. A conclusion
should not be emphasized by the sly device of
dishing up the same subject twice in the same
book. By doing so one proves oneself a clumsy
writer and has to bear the blame for it. However,
the creative power of an author does not, alas,

always follow his good will. A work grows as it
will and sometimes confronts its author as an
independent, even an alien, creation.

incidentally, earned the hearty dislike of all

Jew, and how his character is connected with his
fate, are things one would like to understand
better.

We may start from one character trait of the

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 167

Jews which governs their relationship to other
people. There is no doubt that they have a very
good opinion of themselves, think themselves
nobler, on a higher level, superior to the others
from whom they are also separated by many of
their customs. 1 With this they are animated by
a special trust in life, such as is bestowed by the
secret possession of a precious gift ;

optimism. Religious people would call it trust in

God.

We know the reason of this attitude of theirs
and what their precious treasure is. They really
believe themselves to be God's chosen people;
they hold themselves to be specially near to Him,

and this is what makes them proud and confident.
According to trustworthy accounts they behaved

On the strength of our previous remarks we

the Jewish people with this

enhanced their self-confidence by assuring them
that they were the chosen people of God; he

And since we know that behind the

say this: it was one man, the man Moses,

When, on the one hand, the figure of the great
man has grown into a divine one, it is time to
remember, on the other hand, that the father
also was once a child. The great religious idea
for which the man Moses stood was, as we have
stated, not his own; he had taken it over from
his King Ikhnaton.
And the latter whose
greatness as a founder of religion is proved without a doubt followed perhaps intimations which

The Progress in Spirituality

To achieve lasting psychical effects in a people it
is obviously not sufficient to assure

them that they

were specially chosen by God. This assurance
must be proved if they are to attach belief to it
and draw their conclusions from that belief. In
the religion of Moses the exodus served as such
a proof; God, or Moses in his name, did not tire
of citing this proof of favour.

The feast of the

Passover was established to keep this event in
mind, or rather an old feast was endowed with

memory. Yet it was only a memory. The
exodus itself belonged to a dim past. At the

identity of king and god, i.e. their common

also are in the habit of thus getting rid of their

kings if the splendour of their reign is dulled by
defeats accompanied by the loss of land and

money. Why the people of Israel, however,
adhered to their God all the more devotedly the
worse they were treated by Him that is a
question which we must leave open for the
moment.
It may stimulate us to enquire whether the
religion of Moses had given the people nothing
else but an increase in self-confidence through the

the way to becoming human.

a victory of spirituality over the senses, that is to
say a step forward in culture, since maternity is

declaration in favour of the thought process, there-

by raising it above sense perception, was proved
to be a step charged with serious consequences.

image of spirituality, since the spirit borrows its
name from the breath of wind (animus, spiritus,

For an explanation we turn to

an analogous case in the psychology of the
individual which we have learned to understand.
When the Id makes an instinctual demand of
an erotic or aggressive nature on a human being,
the most simple and natural response for the Ego,
which governs the apparatus for thinking and
muscle innervation, is to satisfy this by an action.
This satisfaction of the instinct is felt as pleasure
by the Ego, just as not satisfying this instinct
would undoubtedly become a source of discomfort. Now it may happen that the Ego eschews
satisfaction of the instinct because of external
obstacles, namely, when it realizes that the action
in question would bring in its course serious

outer world becomes internalized; a standard
is created in the Ego which opposes the other
faculties by observation, criticism and prohibition.

We call this new standard the super -ego. From now
on the Ego, before undertaking

to

satisfy

the

instincts, has to consider not only the dangers ol
the outer world, but also the objections of the

super-ego, and has therefore more occasion for
refraining from satisfying the instinct. While,

however, instinctual renunciation for external
reasons is only painful, renunciation for internal
reasons, in obedience to the demands of the superIt brings
ego, has another economic effect.
besides the inevitable pain a gain in pleasure to
the Ego as it were, a substitutive satisfaction.
The Ego feels uplifted; it is proud of the renunciation as of a valuable achievement. We think we
can follow the mechanism of this gain in pleasure.

The super-ego is the successor and representative
of the parents (and educators), who superintended
the actions of the individual in his first years of
life;

it perpetuates their functions almost without

a change.

It keeps the Ego in lasting dependence

a steady pressure. The Ego is
concerned, just as it was in childhood, to retain
the love of its master, and it feels his appreciation

the sacrifice to the super-ego of renouncing an

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 185

by being loved all the more. The consciousness
of deserving this love is felt as pride. At a time
when the authority was not yet internalized as
super-ego the relation between the threatened loss
of love and the instinctual demand would have
been the same. A feeling of security and satisfaction results if out of love to one's parents one

How does this explanation of gaining satisfaction through instinctual renunciation help us in

One might say: the great man is the

authority for whose sake the effort is made, and
since the great man achieves this because he is a
father substitute we need not be surprised if he
is allotted the role of super -ego in

mass psychology.

This would, therefore, hold good for the man
Moses in his relationship to the Jewish people.
In other points, however, there would seem to be

no proper analogy. The progress in spirituality

1

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

86

consists

in

perception

deciding against the direct sense
in favour of the so-called higher

intellectual processes, that is to say, in favour of

memories, reflection and deduction. An example
of this would be the decision that paternity is
more important than maternity, although the
former cannot be proved by the senses as the
latter can. This is why the child has to have the
father's name and inherit after him. Another
example would be: our God is the greatest and
mightiest, although He is invisible like the storm
and the soul. Rejecting a sexual or aggressive
instinctual demand seems to be something very
different from this. In many examples of progress
in spirituality for instance, in the triumph of
father -right we cannot point to the authority
that provides the measure for what is to be valued
the more highly. In this case it cannot be the
father himself, since it is only this progress that
raises

him to the rank of an authority.

We are,

therefore, confronted with the phenomenon that

during the development of mankind the world of
the senses becomes gradually mastered by spirituality,

and that man feels proud and uplifted by

each such step in progress. One does not know,
however, why this should be so. Still later it

happens that spirituality itself is overpowered by
the altogether mysterious emotional phenomenon

may seem that instinctual renunciation, and the

to religion. Totemism, the first form of religion

judgement is disturbed by the numerous attempts
to lay claim to the character of holiness by so
many other things, persons, institutions and
procedures that have little to do with religion.
These endeavours are often plainly tendentious.
Let us proceed from the feature of prohibition
which adheres so closely to religion. The sacred
is obviously something that must not be touched.

A sacred prohibition has a very strong affective
note, but actually it has no rational motivation.

For why should it be such a specially hideous
crime to commit incest with a daughter or sister,
so much more so than any other sexual relations ?
When we ask for an explanation we shall surely
be told that all our feelings cry out against such
a crime. Yet all this means is that the prohibition
is taken to be self-evident, that we do not know

how to explain it.
That such an explanation is illusory can easily
be proved. What is reputed to offend our feelings
used to be a general custom one might say a
sacred tradition

in the ruling families of the

Ancient Egyptians and other peoples. It went
without saying that each Pharaoh found his first

and foremost wife in his sister, and the successors
of the Pharaohs, the Greek Ptolemies, did not
hesitate to follow this example. So far we seem

to

discern

that

and reserved for kings who

Our reconstruction of pre-history forces another
explanation on us. The law of Exogamy, the
negative expression of which is the fear of incest,
was the will of the father and continued it after
his murder.

Hence the strength of its affectivity

The will of the father, however, was not only
something which one must not touch, which one

which made one shudder because it necessitated

The Truth in Religion

How we who have little belief envy those who
are convinced of the existence of a Supreme
Power, for whom the world holds no problems
because He Himself has created all its institutions
!

How comprehensive, exhaustive and final are the
doctrines of the believers compared with the
laboured, poor and patchy attempts at explanation which are the best we can produce. The
Divine Spirit, which in itself is the ideal of ethical
perfection, has planted within the soul of men the
knowledge of this ideal and at the same time the

urge to strive toward it. They feel immediately
what is high and noble and what low and mean.

Their emotional life is measured by the distance

world had not enough problems, we are confronted with the task of finding out how those who

have faith in a Divine Being could have acquired
it, and whence this belief derives the enormous
power that enables it to overwhelm Reason and
Science. 1

Let us return to the more modest problem that
has occupied us so far. We set out to explain
whence comes the peculiar character of the Jewish
people which in all probability is what has
enabled that people to survive until to-day. We
found that the man Moses created their character
by giving to them a religion which heightened
their self-confidence to such a degree that they
believed themselves to be superior to all other
peoples. They survived
the others.

to enjoy the proofs of his special favour, and
a pro(3) because it forced upon the people
gress in spirituality which, significant enough
in itself, further opened the way to respect for
to further instinctual
intellectual work and
renunciations.

This then is the conclusion we have attained,
but, although I do not wish to retract anything

have said before, I cannot help feeling that it is
somehow not altogether satisfactory. The cause
does not, so to speak, accord with the result.
The fact we are trying to explain seems to be
incommensurate with everything we adduce by
way of explanation. Is it possible that all our
investigations have so far discovered not the
whole motivation, but only a superficial layer, and
that behind this lies hidden another very signifiI

cant component ? Considering how extraordinarily complicated all causation in life and history
is

we should have been prepared for something

of that kind.

The path to this deeper motivation starts at a
certain passage in the previous discussion. The

the effect. It took a long time, many centuries,

development of a people's character is concerned.
Our modification, however, refers to a fact which
we have taken from the history of Jewish religion
or, if one prefers, introduced into it. We said
that the Jewish people shook off the religion of
Moses after a certain time; whether they did so
completely or whether they retained some of its
precepts we cannot tell. In accepting the supposition that during the long period of the fight
for Canaan, and the struggles with the peoples

In an earlier chapter of this book we have discussed the hypothesis that would seem to be
inevitable if we are to find comprehensible such

an achievement on the part of tradition.

This matters little,

strictly defined and the mechanisms are to a
certain extent the same. It is much more impor-

tant whether the changes in question take place
in the ego itself or whether they confront it as
alien; in the latter case they are called symptoms.

From the fullness of the material at my disposal
I will

choose cases that concern the formation of

character.

A young girl had developed into the most
decided contrast to her mother;

she had culti-

vated all the qualities she missed in her mother

and avoided all those that reminded her of her
mother. We may add that in former years she
had identified herself with her mother like any
other female child and had now come to oppose
this identification energetically.

When this girl

married, however, and became a wife and mother
in her turn, we are surprised to find that she

became more and more like the mother towards
whom she felt so inimical, until at last the mother

198

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

had overcome had once more
unmistakably won the day. The same thing
happens with boys, and even the great Goethe,
identification she

who in his Sturm und Drang period certainly did
not respect his pedantic and stiff father very
highly, developed in old age traits that belonged
to his father's character. This result will stand
out more strikingly where the contrast between
the two persons is

more pronounced.

A young

man, whose fate was determined by his having
to grow up with a good-for-nothing father,
developed at first in spite of the father into a
capable, trustworthy and honourable man. In
the prime of life his character changed and from
now on he behaved as if he had taken this same
father as his example. So as not to lose the
connection with our topic we must keep in mind
that at the beginning of such a process there
always exists an identification with the father
from early childhood days. This gets repudiated,
even over -compensated, and in the end again

comes to light.
It

has long since become common knowledge

that the experience of the first five years of child-

hood exert a decisive influence on our life, one
which later events oppose in vain. Much could
be said about how these early experiences resist
all efforts of more mature years to modify them,
but this would not be relevant. It may not be so
well known, however, that the strongest obsessive

incompletely fitted for accepting them. The fact
itself cannot be doubted, but it seems so strange
that we might try to make it easier to understand

by a simile; the process may be compared to a

into a picture after a short or long interval. Here

the age of two he may never again remember,

events. At any time in later years, however, they
may break into his life with obsessive impulsiveness, direct his actions, force him to like or dislike

people and often decide the choice of his loveobject by a preference that so often cannot be
rationally defended. The two points that touch
on our problem are unmistakable. They are,

The Historical Truth

We have made all these psychological digressions

let us assume we have succeeded in proving this

conclusively; the impression would still remain
that we had satisfied only the qualitative factor

of our task, not the quantitative as well.

To all

matters concerning the creation of a religion
and certainly to that of the Jewish one pertains

something majestic, which has not so far been
covered by our explanations. Some other element
should have part in it: one that has few analogies

and nothing quite like it, something unique and
commensurate with that which has grown out of
something like religion itself.
Let us see if we can approach our subject from
the reverse side. We understand that primitive
man needs a God as creator of the world, as head
of his tribe, and as one who takes care of him.
This God takes his place behind the dead fathers
it,

of whom tradition still has something to relate.

Man in later times of our time, for instance
behaves similarly. He also remains infantile and
needs protection, even when he is fully grown;
he feels he cannot relinquish the support of his

It also meant sacrificing some of the intimate
relationship if the God became universal and
cared equally for all lands and peoples. One had,
so to speak, to share one's God with strangers and
had to compensate oneself for that by believing
that one was favoured by him. The point could
be made that the conception of an Only God
signifies a step forward in spirituality;

this point,

however, cannot be estimated so very highly.
The true believer knows of a way adequately to
fill in this obvious
gap in motivation. He says
that the idea of an Only God has had this over-

whelming effect on mankind because it is part of
eternal truth, which, hidden for so long, has at
last come to light and has swept all before it.

by brute force, appropriated all the females and
belaboured or killed all the young males, including his own sons. From Atkinson I received the
suggestion that this patriarchal system came to an
end through a rebellion of the sons, who united
against the father, overpowered him and together

which I venture to treat as equivalent to repressed

We must conclude that the mental residue of those
primaeval times has become a heritage which,

here of the example of speech symbolism, which

Highest Being seems to have appeared early; at
first it was shadowy and devoid of any connection
with the daily interests of mankind. As the tribes
and peoples were knit together into larger unities
the gods also became organized into families and
hierarchies. Often one of them was elevated to
be the overlord of gods and men. The next step,
to worship only one God, was taken hesitatingly,
and at long last the decision was made to
concede all power to one God only and not to
suffer any other gods beside him. Only then was
the grandeur of the primaeval father restored;
the emotions belonging to him could now be
repeated.

The first effect of the reunion with what men
had long missed and yearned for was overwhelming and exactly as the tradition of the law -giving
on Mount Sinai depicts it. There was admiration,
awe and gratitude that the people had found
favour in His eyes: the religion of Moses knows of
only these positive feelings towards the Father
God. The conviction that His power was

irresistible, the subjection to His will, could not
have been more absolute with the helpless,
intimidated son of the father of the horde than
they were here; indeed, they become fully com-

prehensible only by the transformation into the
primitive

and infantile milieu.

Infantile feelings

are far more intense and inexhaustibly deep than

only religious ecstasy can
bring back that intensity. Thus a transport of
devotion to God is the first response to the return

of the Great Father.
The direction of this Father religion was thus
fixed for all time, but its development was not
thereby finished. Ambivalency belongs to the

there was no room for direct expression of the
murderous father-hate. Only a powerful reaction
to it could make its appearance: the consciousness of guilt because of that hostility, the bad
conscience because one had sinned against God

and continued so to sin. This feeling of guiltiness,
which the Prophets incessantly kept alive and
which soon became an integral part of the
religious system itself, had another, superficial,
motivation which cleverly veiled the true origin
of the feeling. The people met with hard times;
the hopes based on the favour of God were slow in
being fulfilled; it became not easy to adhere to
the illusion, cherished above

all else,

that they

were God's chosen people. If they wished to keep
happiness, then the consciousness of guilt because
they themselves were such sinners offered a

MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

212

welcome excuse for God's severity. They deserved
nothing better than to be punished by Him,
because they did not observe the laws; the need
for satisfying this feeling of guilt, which
coming
from a much deeper source was insatiable, made
them render their religious precepts ever and ever
more strict, more exacting, but also more petty.
In a new transport of moral asceticism the Jews
imposed on themselves constantly increasing
instinctual renunciation, and thereby reached
at least in doctrine and precepts

that

had remained

inaccessible

ethical heights
to

the

other

peoples of antiquity. Many Jews regard these
aspirations as the second main characteristic, and
the second great achievement, of their religion.

Our investigation is intended to show how it is
connected with the first one, the conception of
the one and only God. The origin, however, of
this ethics in feelings of guilt, due to the repressed
hostility to God, cannot be gainsaid. It bears the
characteristic of being never concluded and never
able to be concluded with which we are familiar
in the reaction -formations of the obsessional
neurosis.

The further development transcends Judaism.
Other elements re-emerging from the drama
enacted around the person of the primaeval
father were in no way to be reconciled with the
Mosaic religion. The consciousness of guilt in
that epoch was no longer restricted to the Jews;

proceeded from the Jews. Although food for the
idea had been provided by many suggestive
hints from various quarters, it was, nevertheless,
in the mind of a Jew, Saul of Tarsus, who as a

Roman citizen was called Paul, that the perception dawned:

"it is because we killed God the

salvation.^The fact of the father-murder,
ever, had on its return to the memory of mankind
to overcome greater obstacles than the one which
constituted the essence of monotheism;

it

had to

undergo a more extensive distortion. The unmentionable crime was replaced by the tenet of
the

somewhat

shadowy conception of

orig-

inal sin.

Original sin and salvation through sacrificial
death became the basis of the new religion
founded by Paul. The question whether there

was a leader and instigator to the murder among
the horde of brothers who rebelled against the
primaeval father, or whether that figure was

created later by poets who identified themselves
with the hero and was then incorporated into

must remain unanswered. After the
Christian doctrine had burst the confines of
Judaism, it absorbed constituents from many
other sources, renounced many features of pure
monotheism and adopted in many particulars
the ritual of the other Mediterranean peoples.
It was as if Egypt had come to wreak her vengeance on the heirs of Ikhnaton. The way in which
tradition,

the new religion came to terms with the ancient

ambivalency in the father -son relationship is
noteworthy. Its main doctrine, to be sure, was
the

reconciliation

with

God

the

Father,

the

expiation of the crime committed against Him ;
but the other side of the relationship manifested

HIS PEOPLE AND MONOTHEISTIC RELIGION 215

who had taken the guilt on his
becoming God himself beside the
Son

Father and in truth in place of the Father.
Originally a Father religion, Christianity became
a Son religion. The fate of having to displace the
Father it could not escape.
Only a part of the Jewish people accepted the

new doctrine. Those who refused to do so are
still

called Jews.

Through this decision they are

more sharply separated from the rest of the
world than they were before. They had to suffer
still

the reproach from the new religious community

which besides Jews included Egyptians, Greeks,
Syrians, Romans and lastly also Teutons that
they had murdered God. In its full form this
"
they will not admit that
reproach would run:
they killed God, whereas we do and are cleansed
from the guilt of it. 55 Then it is easy to understand
what truth lies behind this reproach. Why the
Jews were unable to participate in the progress
which this confession to the murder of God
betokened (in spite of all its distortion) might
well be the subject of a special investigation.
Through this they have, so to speak, shouldered
a tragic guilt. They have been made to suffer
severely for it.
Our research has perhaps thrown some light
on the question how the Jewish people acquired

the qualities that characterize it.

The problem

how they could survive until to-day as an entity

has not proved so easy to solve. One cannot,
however, reasonably demand or expect exhaustive
answers of such enigmas. All that I can offer is a
simple contribution, and one which should be
appraised with due regard to the critical limitations I have already mentioned.
