The relations ofanindividual tohisparents and
tohisbrothers and sisters, totheobjectofhislove,
and tohisphysician—infact alltherelations which
have hitherto been the chiefsubjectofpsycho-

social phenomena; and inthisrespect theymaybe

,inwhich the satisfaction ofthe
instincts ispartiallyortotally withdrawn from the
influence ofotherpeople. The contrast between
social and narcissistic—Bleuler would perhapscall
them 'autistic'—mental acts therefore falls wholly
within thedomain ofIndividualPsycholog}^and is
notwell calculated todifferentiate itfrom aSocial
orGroup Psychology.
The individual intherelations w^hich have already

Although Group Psychologyisonlyinitsinfancy,
itembraces animmense number ofseparateissues

LEBON'S DESCRIPTION OFTHEGROUP MIND
Instead ofstartingfrom adefinition,itseems
more useful tobeginwithsome indication ofthe
rangeofthephenomena under review, and toselect
from among them afewspecially strikingand
characteristic facts towhich ourinquirycanbe
attached. Wecan achieve both ofthese aims by
means ofquotationfromLeBon'sdeservedly famous

byadescriptionofthethingthat istobe

Iwillnow letLeBon speakforhimself. He
says: 'The moststriking peculiarity presented bya

LeBon'sDescription oftheGroupMind 9
LeBon thinks that theparticular acquirements
ofindividuals become obliterated inagroup, and
that inthiswaytheir distinctiveness vanishes. The
racial unconscious emerges;what isheterogeneousis
submergedinwhat ishomogeneous. Wemay say
~that-^the mentalsuperstructure,thedevelopmentof
which inindividuals shows such dissimilarities,is
removed, and that theunconscious foundations, which
aresimilar ineveryone,stand exposedtoview.^
Inthiswayindividuals inagroupwouldcome\^
toshow an.averagecharacter. ButLeBon believes^
thattheyalsodisplay new characteristics which they
have notpreviously possessed, andheseeks the
reason forthis inthree different factors.
^*The first isthat theindividualforming part oft.-
agroup acquires, solely from numerical considerations,
asentiment ofinvincible powerwhich allows himto'
yieldtoinstincts which, hadhebeen alone, hewould
perforcehave kept under restraint. He willbethe
lessdisposedtocheck himself from ±heconsideration
that, agroup being anonymous, and inconsequence
irresponsible,thesentiment ofresponsibilitywhich
alwayscontrols individualsdisappears entirely.' (p.33.)y
From ourpointofviewweneed not attribute
somuch importancetotheappearanceofnew
characteristics. Forus itwould beenough\osay
that inagrouptheindividual isbroughtunder con-
ditions which allow him tothrow offtherepressions'

oursowingtohisconceptoftheunconscious notquite coinciding
with theoneadopted bypsycho-analysis. LeBon's unconscious
more especiallycontains themost deeply buried features ofthe
racial mind, which asamatter offact liesoutside thescopeof
psycho-analysis. Wedonot failtorecognize, indeed, thatthe
ego's nucleus, which comprisesthe'archaic inheritance' ofthe
human mind,isunconscious; but inaddition tothiswe

degreethatanindividualreadilysacrifices hispersonal
interest tothecollective interest. This isanaptitude
very contrarytohisnature, andofwhich aman is
scarcely capable, except when hemakespartofa
group.' (p.33.)
We shall later onbase animportant conjecture
uponthis laststatement.
*Athird cause, andbyfarthemostimportant,
determines intheindividuals ofagroup specialcha-
racteristics which arequite contraryattimes to
thosepresented bytheisolated individual. Iallude
tothatsuggestibilityofwhich, moreover, thecontagion
mentioned above isonlyaneffect.
'Tounderstand thisphenomenonitisnecessary
tobear inmind certain recentphysiologicaldiscoveries.
Weknowto-daythatbyvarious processes anindivid- \
ualmaybebroughtinto such acondition that,
having entirelylost hisconsciouspersonality, heobeys
allthesuggestionsoftheoperator who hasdeprived
him ofit,andcommits acts inutter contradiction
with hischaracter and habits. The most careful
investigations seem toprovethat anindividual im-
mersed forsomelengthoftime inagroupinaction
soon finds himself—either inconsequenceofthe
magneticinfluencegivenoutbythegroup,orfrom
some other cause ofwhich weareignorant—ina
special state, which much resembles the state of
fascination inwhich thehypnotisedindividual finds
12Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
himself inthehands ofthehypnotiser.. . .The
consciouspersonalityhasentirely vanished;will
anddiscernment are lost. Allfeelingsandthoughts
are bent inthe direction determined bythe
hypnotiser.
'Such also isapproximatelythe state ofthe
individualforming partofapsychological group. He
isnolongerconscious ofhisacts. Inhiscase, as
inthecase ofthehypnotised subject,atthesame
time that certain faculties aredestroyed,others may
bebroughttoahigh degreeofexaltation. Under
the influence ofasuggestion, hewillundertake the
accomplishmentofcertain acts with irresistible im-
petuosity. This impetuosityisthemore irresistible in
thecase ofgroupsthan inthat ofthehypnotised
subject, from thefact that, thesuggestion beingthe
same for alltheindividuals ofthegroup,itgainsin
strength byreciprocity.' (p.34.)
*We see, then, that thedisappearanceofthe
consciouspersonality,thepredominanceoftheun-
consciouspersonality,theturning bymeans ofsug-
gestion andcontagionoffeelings and ideas inan
identical direction, thetendencytoimmediatelytrans-
form thesuggestedideas intoacts; these, wesee,are
theprincipalcharacteristics oftheindividualforming
partofagroup. He isnolonger himself, buthas
become anautomaton whohasceased tobeguided
byhiswill.'(p.35.)
LeBon' sDescription oftheGroupMind 13
Ihavequotedthispassagesofullyinorder to
make itquiteclear thatLeBonexplainsthecondition
ofanindividual inagroupasbeing actually hypnotic,
anddoes notmerely make acomparison between
thetwo states.Wehave nointention ofraising any
objectionatthispoint,butwishonlytoemphasize
the fact that the tw^o lastcauses ofanindividual
becomingaltered inagroup (thecontagionandthe
heightened suggestibility)areevidentlynotonapar,
since thecontagion seemsactuallytobeamanifestation
ofthesuggestibility.Moreover theeffects ofthetwo
factors donotseem tobesharplydifferentiated in
the text ofLeBon's remarks. Wemay perhaps
bestinterprethisstatement ifweconnect thecontagion
with the eftects ofthe individual members ofthe
group upon one another, w^hilewepointtoanother
source forthose manifestations ofsuggestioninthe
groupwhich areputonalevel with thephenomena
.ofhypnoticinfluence. But tow^hat source? We
cannot avoidbeingstruck with asense ofdeficiency
whenwenotice thatone ofthe chief elements of
thecomparison, namelytheperson who istoreplace
thehypnotistinthecase ofthegroup,isnotmentioned
inLeBon'sexposition. Buthenevertheless dis-
tinguishes between thisinfluence offascination which
remainsplungedinobscurity andthecontagiouseffect
which the individuals exercise upon oneanother and
bywhich theoriginal suggestionisstrengthened.
14Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
Here isyetanotherimportantconsideration for
helpingustounderstand theindividual inagroup:
*Moreover, bythemere fact thatheformspart of
anorganised group,aman descends severalrungs
intheladder ofcivilisation. Isolated, hemaybea
cultivated individual;inacrowd, he isabarbarian—
thatis,acreatureacting byinstinct. Hepossesses
thespontaneity,theviolence, theferocity, and also
theenthusiasm and heroism ofprimitive beings.'
/(p.36.)Hethen dwellsespecially uponthelow^eringin
intellectualability which anindividualexperiences when
hebecomes mergedinagroup.^
Let usnow leave the individual, and turn to
thegroup mind, as ithasbeen outlined byLeBon.
Itshows notasinglefeature which apsycho-analyst
would find any difficultyinplacingorinderiving
from itssource. LeBon himself shows ustheway
bypointingtoitssimilaritywith themental lifeof
primitive people andofchildren(p.40).

the cruel, brutal anddestructiveinstincts, which lie

Whereas theintellectualcapacityofagroupisalways
farbelow that ofanindividual,itsethical conduct
mayriseashigh above hisas itmay sink deep
below it.
Some other features inLeBon'sdescription
show inaclearlighthow welljustifiedistheidenti-
fication ofthegroup mind with themind ofprimitive
people.Ingroupsthemostcontradictoryideas can
exist sidebysideand tolerate each other, without
anyconflictarising from thelogical contradiction
between them. But this isalso thecase intheun-
conscious mental lifeofindividuals, ofchildren andof
neurotics, aspsycho-analysishaslongpointedout.^
^Inyoung children, for instance, ambivalent emotional
attitudes towards thosewho arenearest tothem exist sideby
side foralong time, without either oftheminterferingwith
theexpression oftheother andcontrary one. Ifeventually a
conflict breaks outbetween thetwo,itisoften settled bythe
child makingachangeofobject anddisplacing one ofthe
ambivalent emotions ontoasubstitute. Thehistory ofthedevel-

naturally runsdirectly counter tosome predominant tendency,
andyetthat thisantagonism does notresult inanyproceedings

Agroup, further,issubjecttothetruly magical

over what isreal; theyarealmost asstronglyin-
fluenced bywhat isuntrue asbywhat istrue.They
have anevident tendency nottodistinguishbetween
thetwo(p.^^),
Wehave pointedoutthat thispredominanceof
the lifeofphantasyand ofthe illusion born ofan
unfulfilled wish istherulingfactor inthepsychology
ofneuroses. Wehave found thatwhat neurotics
areguided byisnotordinary objective reality but
psychological reality. Ahysterical symptomisbased
upon phantasyinstead ofupontherepetitionofreal

neurosis isbased uponthefact ofanevil intention
which was never carried out. Indeed, justasin

What LeBon saysonthesubjectofleaders of

order toawaken thegroup'sfaithjhemust possess
astrong andinipnsing will,which thegroup,which
hasnowill ofitsown, canaccept from him. Le
Bonthen discusses thedifferent kinds ofleaders, and
themeans bywhich theywork uponthegroup. On
thewhole hebelieves thattheleaders make themselves
feltbymeans oftheideas inwhich they themselves
arefanatical believers.
Moreover, heascribes both totheideas and to
theleaders amysteriousand irresistible power,which
hecalls'prestige'. Prestigeisasort ofdomination

Themost remarkable and also themost im-
portantresult oftheformation ofagroupIsthe
'exaltation orintensification ofemotion'
produced
inevery member of it(p.24). InMcDougall's
opinionmen's emotions are stirred inagrouptoa
pitchthat they seldom ornever attain under other
conditions; and itisapleasurable experiencefor
thosewho areconcerned tosurrender themselves so
unreservedlytotheirpassions and thus tobecome
mergedinthegroupand tolose thesense ofthe
limits oftheirindividuality. Themanner inwhich
individuals arethus carried away byacommon im-
pulseisexplained byMcDougall bymeans ofwhat
hecalls the'principleofdirect induction ofemotion
bywayoftheprimitive sympathetic response' (p.25),
thatis,bymeans oftheemotionalcontagionwith
which wearealreadyfamiliar. The fact isthat the
perception ofthesignsofanemotional state is
calculatedautomaticallytoarouse thesame emotion
intheperson whoperceives them. Thegreaterthe
number ofpeopleinwhom thesame emotion can
28Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
\y besimultaneously observed, thestronger does this
automatic compulsion grow. The individual loses his
powerofcriticism, and lets himselfslipinto the
same emotion. But insodoingheincreases the
excitement oftheotherpeople, whohadproduced
this effect upon him,andthus theemotionalcharge
ofthe individuals becomes intensified bymutual
interaction.Somethingisunmistakablyatwork in
thenature ofacompulsiontodothesame asthe
others, toremain inharmonywith themany. The
coarser andsimpler emotions arethemoreaptto
spread throughagroupinthisway (p.39).
Thismechanism fortheintensification ofemotion
isfavoured bysome other influences which emanate
fromgroups. Agroup impressestheindividual with
asense ofunlimited power and ofinsurmountable
peril. For themoment itreplacesthewhole of
humansociety, which isthewielder ofauthorit}^,

remarkable thatweshould seeanindividual ina
group doingorapproving thingswhich hewould
have avoided inthenormal conditions oflife;and in
thiswaywemay even hopetoclear upalittle of
themysterywhich issooften covered bythe
enigmaticword*
suggestion'.
McDougalldoes notdisputethe thesis asto
the collective inhibition ofintelligenceingroups
(p.41).Hesaysthattheminds oflowerintelligence
bring down those ofahigherorder totheirown
level. The latter areobstructed intheiractivity,
because ingeneralan intensification ofemotion
creates unfavourable conditions forsound intellectual
work, and further because the individuals areintim-
idated bythegroupand their mentalactivityis
not free, andbecause there isaloweringineach
individual ofhissense ofresponsibilityforhisown
performances.
Thejudgementwith which McDougall sums
upthepsychologicalbehaviour ofasimple^
unorga-
nised'groupisnomorefriendlythan that of
LeBon. Such agroup*
isexcessively emotional,
impulsive, violent, fickle, inconsistent, irresolute and
extreme inaction, displaying onlythecoarser emo-
tions and the less refined sentiments; extremely
suggestible,careless indeliberation, hastyinjudg-
ment, incapableofany but the simpler and
imperfect forms ofreasoning; easily swayedandled,
30Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
lackinginself-consciousness, devoid ofself-respect and
ofsense ofresponsibility, andapttobecarried away
bytheconsciousness ofitsown force, sothat it
tends toproduceallthe manifestations wehave
learnt toexpectofany irresponsible and absolute
power. Hence itsbehaviour islike thatofanunruly
child oranuntutored passionate savageinastrange
situation, rather than likethatofitsaverage member;
and intheworst cases itislikethat ofawild beast,
rather than like that ofhumanbeings.' (p.45.)
Since McDougallcontrasts thebehaviour ofa
highly organised groupwithwhat hasjustbeen des-
cribed, we shall beparticularlyinterested tolearn
inwhat thisorganisation consists, andbywhat
factors itisproduced. The author enumerates five
/^
principalconditions'forraisingcollective mental
^
lifetoahigherlevel.
The firstandfundamental condition isthatthere
should besomedegreeofcontinuityofexistence in
thegroup.Thismaybeeither material orformal:
the former,ifthesame individualspersistinthe
groupforsome time; and the latter,ifthere is
developedwithin thegroupasystemoffixedpositions
which areoccupied byasuccession ofindividuals.
Thesecond condition isthat inthe individual
member ofthegroupsome definite idea should be
formed ofthe nature, composition,functions and
capacitiesofthegroup,sothatfrom thishemay

developanemotional relation tothegroupasa
whole.
The third isthat thegroupshould bebrought
into interaction (perhapsintheform ofrivalry)with
other groupssimilar to itbutdiffering from itin
many respects.
The fourth isthat thegroupshouldpossess
traditions, customs and habits, andespecially such as
determine the relations of itsmembers toone
another.
The fifth isthat thegroupshould have adefinite
structure, expressedinthespecialisation and differ-
entiation ofthefunctions ofitsconstituents.
AccordingtoMcDougall,ifthese conditions
are fulfilled, thepsychological disadvantagesofthe
groupformation areremoved. The collective lower-
ingofintellectualabilityisavoided bywithdrawing
theperformanceofintellectual tasks from thegroup
andreserving them forindividual members of it.
Itseems tousthat the condition which
McDougall designatesasthe'
organisation'ofa
groupcanwithmorejustification bedescribed in
another way. Theproblemconsists inhow topro-
cure forthegroup preciselythose features which
were characteristic ofthe individual andwhich are
extinguishedinhimbytheformation ofthegroup.
For the individual, outside theprimitive group,
possessedhisowncontinuity,hisself-consciousness,

tions andposition, andkept apart from his rivals.
Owingtohisentryintoan^

SUGGESTION AND LIBIDO
^
We started from the fundamental fact that an
individual inagroupissubjected throughitsinfluence
towhat isoften aprofoundalteration inhismental
activity. Hisemotions becomeextraordinarilyinten-
sified, while hisintellectualability becomes markedly
reduced, both processes being evidentlyinthe
direction ofanapproximationtotheother individuals
inthegroup;and this result canonlybereached
bytheremoval ofthose inhibitions uponhisinstincts
which arepeculiartoeach individual, andbyhis
resigningthoseexpressionsofhisinclinations which
areespeciallyhisown.Wehave heard that these
often unwelcomeconsequencesaretosome extent
atleast prevented byahigher*
organisation'ofthe
group;but thisdoes notcontradict thefundamental
fact ofGroup Psychology—thetwo theses asto
the intensification oftheemotions and the inhibition
ofthe intellect inprimitive groups. Our interest isI
34Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
now directed todiscoveringthepsychological explan-
ation ofthismental changewhich isexperienced b}'
theindividual inagroup.
Itisclear that rational factors (suchasthe in-
timidation oftheindividual which hasalready been
mentioned, thatis,theaction ofhis instinct ofself-
preservation)donotcover theobservable phenomena.
Beyondthiswhatweareoffered asanexplanation
byauthorities upon SociologyandGroup Psychology
isalwaysthesame, even thoughitisgivenvarious
names, and that is—themagicw^ord'suggestion'.
Tarde calls it'imitation'
;butwecannothelp

comes under theconceptofsuggestion,and isin
factoneofitsresults.^ LeBon traces back allthe
puzzlingfeatures ofsocial phenomenatotwo factors:
themutualsuggestionofindividuals and theprestige
ofleaders. Butprestige, again,isonly recognizable
byitscapacityforevoking suggestion. McDougall

onfurther consideration weareforced toperceive
that thisprinciple says nomore than the familiar

There isnodoubt thatsomethingexists inus

Instead ofthis Ishallmake anattemptatusing
theconceptoflibido forthepurposeofthrowing
lightupon Group Psychology,aconcept which has
done ussuchgoodservice inthestudyofpsycho-
neuroses.
Libido isanexpressiontaken from thetheory
oftheemotions. We callbythatname theenergyI
(regardedasaquantitative magnitude, thoughnot
atpresent actually mensurable) ofthose instincts
which have todowith allthatmaybecomprised
under theword Move'. The nucleus ofwhatwe
mean bylove naturallyconsists (and this iswhat is
commonlycalled love, andwhat thepoets sing of)
insexual love with sexual union asitsaim. Butwe
38Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
donotseparate from this—what inanycase hasa
share inthename*love'—ontheonehand, self-love,
andonthe other, love forparents and children,
friendship and love forhumanityingeneral,and also
devotion toconcreteobjects and toabstract ideas.
Ourjustificationlies inthefact thatpsycho-analytic
research hastaughtusthat allthese tendencies are
anexpressionofthesame instinctiveactivities;in
relations between thesexes these instincts force their
waytowards sexual union^but inother circumstances
theyare diverted from thisaim orareprevented
fromreaching it,though always preserving enough
oftheiroriginalnature tokeeptheiridentity recog-
nizable (as insuch features asthelongingfor
proximity, andself-sacrifice).
Weareofopinion, then, thatlanguagehascarried
outanentirely justifiable pieceofunification in
creatingtheword^love'with itsnumerous uses,and
thatwecannot dobetter than take itasthebasis

TWO ARTIFICIAL GROUPS: THECHURCH
ANDTHEARMY
Wemayrecall from what weknow ofthe
morphologyofgroupsthat itispossibletodistinguish
verydifferent kinds ofgroups andopposinglines in
their development. There arevery fleeting groups
andextremely lasting ones; homogeneous ones,made
upofthesame sorts ofindividuals, andunhomoge-
neous ones;naturalgroups, apdartificial ones, requiring
anexternal force tokeep themtogether; primitive
groups,andhighly organisedones with adefinite
structure. But forreasons which haveyettobe
explained weshould liketolayparticularstress upon
adistinction tov/hich the authorities have rather
giventoo littleattention;Irefer tothatbetween
leaderlessgroups and those with leaders. And, in
complete oppositiontotheusualpractice, we shall
notchoose arelatively simple groupformation as
ourpointofdeparture, but shallbeginwithhighly
organised, lasting and artificialgroups. Themost
42Group Psychology andtheA^ialysis oftheEgo
interesting exampleofsuch structures arechurches—
communities ofbelievers—andarmies.
Achurch andanarmyare artificialgroups,that
is,acertain external force isemployedtoprevent
them fromdisintegratingand tocheck alterations in
their structure. Asaruleapersonisnotconsulted,
or isgiven nochoice, astowhether hewants to

ment, orhasquitedefinite conditions attached to it.
It isquiteoutside ourpresentinterest toenquire
why these associations need suchspecial safeguards.We areonlyattracted byonecircumstance, namely
that certain facts, which are farmore concealed in
other cases, canbeobserved very clearlyinthose
highly organised groupswhich areprotectedfrom
dissolution inthemanner that hasbeen mentioned.

uponthe individual arederived from this love of

theChurch, forthevery reason that before Christ
everyoneisequal, and thateveryone' hasanequal
share inhislove. Itisnotwithout adeep reason
that thesimilarity between theChristian communit}''
and afamilyisinvoked, and that believers call
themselves brothers inChrist, thatis,brothers
throughthelove which Christ has forthem. There
isnodoubt that the tiewhich unites each
individual with Christ isalso thecause ofthe tie
which unites them withoneanother. The likeholds^
goodofanai'my. The Commander-in-Chief isa
father who loves allhissoldiersequally,and forthat
reason they arecomrades amongthemselves. The
armydiffersstructurally from theChurch inbeing
built upofaseries ofsuchgroups. Ever}^ captain
is,as itwere, theCommander-in-Chief andthefather
ofhiscompany, and so isevery non-commissioned
officer ofhis section. It istrue that asimilar
hierarchyhasbeen constructed intheChurch, but it
does notplaythesame partiniteconomically;for

those ofone's country, ofnationalglory, etc.,which areofsuch
importanceinholding anarmy together. Theanswer isthat
that isadififerent instance ofagroup tie,andnolongersuch a

betterappreciated, thefantastic promisesoftheAmerican Presi-
dent's fourteenpoints would probablynothave been believed
soeasily, andthesplendid instrument would nothavebroken in

reserved forsubsequent enquiry.Butwe shall ven-

lack offreedom inagroup.Ifeach individual is
bound intwo directions bysuchanintense emotional

circumstance thealteration and limitation which have
been observed inhispersonality.
Ahint tothesame effect, that theessence of
agrouplies inthe libidinal tiesexistinginit,isalso
tobefound inthephenomenonofpanic, which is
best studied inmilitary groups. Apanicarises if

that each individual isonlysolicitous onhisown

that itisrather theotherwayround; and that the

ofexplanationisherequite inadequate.The ver\^
questionthatneeds explanationiswhythedread has
become sogigantic.Thegreatnessofthedanger

falls avictim topanic may previouslyhave faced
equally greatorgreater dangerwith complete
success;itisoftheveryessence ofpanicthat it
bears norelation tothedangerthat threatens, and
often breaks outuponthemost trivial occasions.
Ifanindividual inpanicdreadbeginstobesolicitous
/only onhisown account, hebears witness inso
doingtothefact that theemotional ties,which have
hitherto made thedangerseem small tohim, have
TwoArtificial Groups:theChurch andtheArmy 47
ceased toexist. Now thathe isbyhimself infacing
thedanger,hemay surelythink itgreater. The fact
is,therefore,, thatpanic dreadpresupposesarelaxation
inthe libidinal structure ofthegroup and reacts to
itinajustifiable manner, and thecontrary view—
that the libidinal ties ofthegrouparedestroyed
owingtodread intheface ofthedanger—canbe
refuted.
The contention thatdread inagroupisincreas-
edtoenormousproportions bymeans ofinduction
(contagion)isnot intheleast contradicted bythese
remarks.McDougall'sview meets thecaseentirely
when thedangerisareally great oneandwhen the
grouphasnostrongemotional ties—conditions which
arefulfilled, forinstance, when afirebreaks out ina
theatre oraplace ofamusement. But thereally
instructive caseandtheonewhich canbebestem-
ployedforourpurposesisthatmentioned above, in
which abody oftroops breaks into apanic although
thedangerhasnotincreased beyond adegreethat
isusual andhasoften beenpreviouslyfaced. Itis
nottobeexpectedthat theusageoftheword
*
panic'should beclearly andunambiguouslydeter-
mined. Sometimes itisused todescribe anycollec-
tivedread, sometimes even dread inanindividual
when itexceeds allbounds, and often thename
seems tobereserved forcases inwhich theoutbreak
ofdread isnotwarranted bythe occasion. Ifwe

take theword'
panic'inthesense ofcollective
dread, wecan establish afar-reaching analogy.
Dread inanindividual isprovokedeither bythe
greatnessofadangerorbythecessation ofemo-
tional ties (libidinal cathexes^\Libidobesetzungen\)\the
latter isthecase ofneurotic dread.^ Injustthe
sameway panicarises either owingtoanincrease
ofthecommon dangerorowingtothedisappearance
oftheemotional tieswhich hold thegroup together;
andthe latter case isanalogoustothat ofneurotic
dread.^

Anyone who, likeMcDougall (1.c), describes
apanicasone oftheplainest functions ofthe
'
group mind'
,arrives attheparadoxical positionthat
thisgroup mind doesaway with itself inone ofits
moststrikingmanifestations. It isimpossible to
doubt thatpanic means thedisintegrationofagroup;
itinvolves thecessation ofallthefeelingsofcon-
sideration which themembers ofthegroup otherwise
show oneanother.
Thetypicaloccasion oftheoutbreak ofapanic
isverymuch as itisrepresentedinNestroy's parody
ofHebbel'splay aboutJudith and Holofernes. A
soldier cries aut :'Thegeneralhas lost hishead !'
andthereuponalltheAssyrians take toflight. The
lossoftheleader insome sense orother, the birth
ofmisgivingsabout him, brings ontheoutbreak of
panic, thoughthedangerremains thesame; the
mutual tiesbetween themembers ofthegroupdis-
appear,asarule, atthesame time asthe tiewith
their leader. Thegroupvanishes indust,likea
Bolognaflaskwhen itstopisbroken off.
The dissolution ofareligious groupisnotso
easytoobserve. Ashort timeagothere came into
myhands anEnglishnovel ofCatholicorigin, recom-
mended bytheBishopofLondon, with the title
When ItWasDark, Itgaveaclever and, as it
seems tome, aconvincing pictureofsuch apossi-
bility and itsconsequences.The novel, which is

sepulchreisaninscription,inwhich JosephofAri-
mathaea confesses that forreasons ofpiety he

FURTHER PROBLEMS ANDLINES OFWORK
We have hitherto considered two artificialgroups
andhave found that theyaredominated bytwo
emotional ties. One ofthese, the tiewith theleader,
seems (atallevents forthese cases) tobemore of
arulingfactor than theother, which holds between
themembers ofthegroup.
Nowmuch else remains tobeexamined and
described inthemorphologyofgroups. Weshould
have tostart from theascertained fact that amere
collection ofpeopleisnotagroup,solongasthese
tieshave notbeen established init;butweshould
have toadmit that inanycollection ofpeoplethe
tendencytoform apsychological group may very
easily become prominent. We should have togive
our attention tothe different kinds ofgroups,more
orless stable, that arisespontaneously,and tostudy
theconditions oftheiroriginandoftheir dissolution.
Weshould above allbeconcerned with thedistinction

groups. We should consider whethergroupswith
leaders maynotbethemoreprimitive andcomplete,
whether intheothers anidea, anabstraction, may
notbesubstituted fortheleader (astate ofthings
towhichreligious groups,with their invisible head,
form atransitionstage), andwhether acommon ten-
dency,awish inwhich anumber ofpeoplecanhave
ashare, may not inthesame way serve asa
substitute. This abstraction, again, might bemore
orlesscompletely embodied inthefigureofwhat
wemightcall asecondary leader, andinteresting
varieties w^ould arise from the relation between the
ideaandtheleader. The leader ortheleadingidea
might also, sotospeak,benegative;hatredagainst
aparticular personorinstitutionmight operatein
justthesameunifying way, andmightcallupthe
same kind ofemotional ties aspositiveattachment.
Then thequestionwould also arise whether aleader
isreally indispensabletotheessence ofagroup—
andotherquestionsbesides.
But allthesequestions,which may, moreover,
have been dealt w^ith inpartinthe literature of

social relations ashasbecome familiar topsycho-

oftheindividual libido. The libido propsitself upon
thesatisfaction ofthegreatvitalneeds, andchooses as
itsfirstobjectsthepeople whohave ashare inthat
process. And inthedevelopmentofmankind as a'l

IDENTIFICATION
Identification isknown topsycho-analysisasthe
earliest expressionofanemotional tiewith another
person.Itplaysapartintheearly historyofthe
Oedipus complex. Alittleboywill exhibit aspecial
interest inhisfather; hewould liketogrowlikehim
andbelikehim,andtake hisplace everywhere. We
may saysimplythathetakes hisfather ashisideal.
This behaviour hasnothingtodowith apassiveor
feminine attitude towards hisfather (and towards
males ingeneral);itisonthecontrary typically
masculine. Itfits inverywell with theOedipus
complex,forwhich ithelpstopreparetheway.
Atthesame time asthis identification with his
father, oralittlelater, theboyhasbeguntodevelop

tothe anaclitictype \Anlehnungstypus\} Hethen
*
[Literally,'

*Ileanupagainst'.Inthe firstphase oftheir developmentthe
Identi/ication 61
exhibits, therefore, twopsychologicallydistinct ties:
astraightforwardsexualobject-cathexis towards his
mother andatypicalidentification towards hisfather.
Thetwo subsist sidebyside foratime without any
mutual influence orinterference. Inconsequenceol
the irresistible advance towards aunification ofmental
lifetheycometogetheratlast; and thenormal
Oedipus complex originatesfrom their confluence^
The little boy notices that hisfather stands inhis
waywith hismother. His identification with his
father then takes onahostile colourincr andbecomes
identical with thewish toreplacehisfather inregard
tohismother aswell. Identification, infact,is
ambivcdent from thevery first;itcan turn intoan
expressionoftenderness aseasilyasintoawish for
someone's removal. Itbehaves like aderivative

thispath; thatis,when hechoses ashis firstsexual object the

choice compare 'ZurEinfuhrung desNarzissmus'. —Translator.']
62Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
this standpoint;hehasadevouringaffection forhis
enemies andonly devours people ofwhom he is
fond.^
Thesubsequent history ofthis identification with
thefather may easily belostsightof. Itmayhappen
that theOedipus complex becomes inverted, and
that thefather istaken astheobjectofafeminine
attitude, anobjectfrom which thedirectlysexual
instincts look forsatisfaction;inthatevent theidenti-
fication with thefather hasbecome theprecursorof
anobjecttiewith thefather. Thesame holdsgood,
with thenecessary substitutions, ofthebaby daughter
aswell.
Itiseasytostate inaformula thedistinction
between anidentification with the father and the
choice ofthefather asanobject.Inthe firstcase
one's father iswhat onewould liketobe^and inthe
second he iswhat onewould like tohave. The
distinction, thatis,depends upon whether the tieat-
taches tothesubjectortotheobjectoftheego.
The former isthereforealready possiblebefore any

difficult togiveaclearmetapsychological representa-
tion ofthe distinction. We canonlysee that
identification endeavours tomould aperson's own
egoafter thefashion oftheone thathasbeen taken
asa'model'.
Letusdisentangleidentification as itoccurs in
thestructure ofaneurotic symptom from itsrather
complicatedconnections.Supposingthatalittle^ girl
(andwewillkeeptoher forthepresent) develops
thesamepainful symptomashermother—forinstance,
thesametormenting cough. Now thismaycome
about invarious ways. The identification maycome
from theOedipus complex;inthat case itsignifies
ahostile desire onthegirl's parttotake her
mother'splace, and thesymptom expressesher
object love tow^ards herfather, andbringsabout
arealisation, under the influence ofasense of
guilt,ofher desire totake hermother'splace:
^You wanted tobeyour mother, andnowyou
are—anyhowasfar asthepain goes'.This is
the complete mechanism ofthe structure ofa
hysterical symptom. Or,ontheother hand, the
symptom maybethesame asthat oftheperson
who isloved—(so, for instance, Dora inthe
'Bruchstiick einerHysterieanalyse'^imitated her
father'scough);inthat casewecanonlydescribe
*\Kleine SchriftenzurNeurosenlehre. Zweite Folge.]
64Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
^.thestate ofthings bysayingthatidentification has
<^appearedinsteadofobject-choice ,and thatobject-
'hoice hasregressedtoidentification. Wehaveheard
that identification isthe earliest andoriginalform of
emotionaltie;itoften happensthatunder thecon-
ditions inwhich symptoms areconstructed, thatis,
where there isrepression andwhere themechanisms
oftheunconscious aredominant, object-choiceis
turned back into identification —theego,thatis,as-
sumes thecharacteristics oftheobject.Itisnoticeable
that inthese identifications theegosometimescopies
theperson who isnotloved andsometimes theone
who isloved. Itmust also strike usthat inboth
cases the identification isapartial and extremely
limited oneandonlyborrows asingletraitfrom the
person who isitsobject.
There isathirdparticularly frequentand im-
portantcase ofsymptom formation,inwhich the
identification leaves anyobjectrelation totheperson
who isbeing copied entirely outofaccount. Sup-
posing,forinstance, thatoneofthegirlsinaboarding
school hashadaletter fromsomeone withwhom she
issecretlyinlove which arouses herjealousy,and
that she reacts to itwith afitofhysterics;then
some ofherfriends whoknow about itwillcontract

situation. The othergirlswould like tohave asecret
love affair too,andunder theinfluence ofasense of
guilt theyalso acceptthepain involved in it. It
would bewrongtosupposethatthey take onthe
symptom out ofsympathy. Onthecontrary, the\
sympathy onlyarises outoftheidentification, and
this isproved bythe fact that infection orimitation
ofthiskind takesplaceincircumstances where even
lesspre-existing sympathyistobeassumed than
usuallyexists between friends inagirls'school. One
egohasperceivedasignificant analogywith another
upon onepoint—inourexample upon asimilar
readiness foremotion; anidentification isthereupon
constructed onthispoint, and, under theinfluence
ofthepathogenic situation,isdisplaced ontothe
symptomwhich theoneegohasproduced. The
identification bymeans ofthesymptomhas thus
become themark ofapointofcoincidence between
the tv\^oegoswhich hastobekept repressed.
What wehave learned from these three sources
maybesummarised asfollows. First, identification
istheoriginalform ofemotional tiewithanobject;
secondly,inaregressive wayit-becomes asubstitute
foralibidinalobject tie,as itwerebymeans ofthe
introjectionoftheobjectinto theego;andthirdly,
itmayarise with every newperceptionofacommon
qualityshared withsome other person who isnotan
objectofthesexual instinct. Themore important
66Group Psychologya7tdtheAnalysis oftheEgo
thiscommonquality is,themore successful maythis
partialidentification become, and itmaythusrepre-
sent thebeginningofanew tie.
We already begintodivine that themutual tie
between members ofagroupisinthenature ofan
identification ofthiskind, based upon animportant
emotional commonquality;andwemay suspectthat
thiscommonqualitylies inthenature ofthetiewith
theleader. Another suspicion maytellusthatwe
are farfromhavingexhausted theproblemofidenti-
fication, and thatwearefaced bytheprocess which
psychologycalls^empathy \Einfuhlung\'andwhich
playsthelargest partinourunderstandingofwhat
isinherently foreigntoouregoinotherpeople. But
we shall here limit ourselves totheimmediate emo-
tional effects ofidentification, and shall leave onone
side itssignificanceforour intellectual life.
Psycho-analytic research, which hasalready
occasionally attacked themore difficult problemsof
thepsychoses, has alsobeen able toexhibit iden-
tification tousinsome other cases which arenot
immediately comprehensible.Ishall treat two of
these cases indetail asmaterial forour further
consideration.
Thegenesisofmale homosexualityinalarge

atlast, after theendofhispuberty, thetimecomes
forexchanginghismother forsome other sexual
object. Thingstake asudden turn: theyoung man
does notabandon hismother, but identifies himself
withher; hetransforms himself into her, andnow
looks about forobjects which canreplacehisego
forhim, andonwhich hecanbestow such loveand
care ashehasexperienced from hismother. This is
afrequent process, which canbeconfirmed asoften
asone likes, andwhich isnaturally quite independent
ofanyhypothesisthatmay bemade astotheor-
ganic drivingforce and themotives ofthesudden
transformation. Astriking thingabout ^this identific- \
ation isitsample scale;itremoulds theegoinonej

Inthisprocesstheobject»itself isrenounced—whether

this love isreal, true, actual love, and sohints at
awhole scale ofpossibilitieswithin therangeofthe
phenomenaoflove.We shall have nodifficultyin
makingthesame discovery empirically.
Inone class ofcasesbeinginlove isnothing
more than object-cathexis onthepartofthesexual
instincts with aview todirectlysexual satisfaction, a
cathexis whichexpires, moreover, when thisaimhas
been reached;this iswhat iscalled common, sensual
love. But, asweknow, the libidinal situation rarely
remains sosimple.Itwaspossibletocalculate with

object and for*

itinthepassionlessintervals
aswell.
To thismust beadded another factor derived
from theastonishingcourse ofdevelopment which is
pursued bythe erotic lifeofman. Inhis firstphase,
which hasusually come toanendbythetimehe is
fiveyears old, achild hasfound the firstobjectfor
hislove inone orother ofhisparents, and allof
hissexual instincts with theirdemand forsatisfaction
have been united uponthisobject. Therepression
which then sets incompels him torenounce the
greater number ofthese infantile sexual aims, and
leaves behind aprofound modification inhisrelation
to hisparents. The child still remains tied to
hisparents, butbyinstincts which must bede-
scribed asbeing'inhibited intheiraim\zielgehemmte\\
The emotions which hefeels henceforward towards
theseobjectsofhislove arecharacterized as'tender'.
Itiswellknown that the earlier'sensual'tendencies
remain more orlessstrongly preservedintheun-
conscious, sothat inacertain sense thewhole ofthe
originalcurrent continues toexist.^
Atpuberty,asweknow, there setinnewand
very strong tendencies withdirectlysexual aims. In
unfavourable casestheyremainseparate,intheform
*Cf.DreiAbhandlungen zurSexualtheorie, I.e.
BeinginLoveandHypnosis 73
ofasensual current, from the*tender* emotional
trends whichpersist. Wearethen faced byapicture
thetwo aspects ofwhich certain movements in
literature take suchdelightinidealising. Aman of
this kind willshow asentimental enthusiasm for
women whom hedeeply respects butwhodonot
excite him tosexualactivities, andhewillonlybe
potentwith otherwomen whom hedoes not'love*
but thinks little oforevendespises.^ More often,
however, theadolescent succeeds inbringingabout
acertaindegreeofsynthesis between theunsensual,
heavenlyloveand the sensual, earthly love, and his
relation tohissexualobjectischaracterised bythe
interaction ofuninhibited instincts and ofinstincts
inhibited intheir aim. The depthtowhich anyone
isinlove, ascontrasted with hispurelysensual
desire, maybemeasured bythe size oftheshare
taken bytheinhibited instincts oftendem*ess.
Inconnection with thisquestionofbeinginlovewe
have always been struck bythephenomenon ofsexual
over-estimation —thefact that thelovedobject enjoys
acertain amount offreedom from criticism, andthat
allitscharacteristics arevalued morehighlythanthose
ofpeople who arenotloved, orthan itsownwere
atatimewhen ititselfwasnotloved. Ifthesensual

tendencies aresomewhat more effectively repressed
orsetaside, the illusion isproducedthat theobject
hascome tobesensuallyloved onaccount ofits
spiritual merits, whereas onthecontrarythese merits
may really onlyhave been lent to itbyitssensual
charm.
The tendency which falsifies judgementinthis
respectisthat ofidealisation. But thismakes it
easier forustofindourwayabout.Weseethat
theobjectisbeingtreated inthesamewayasour
ownego,sothatwhenweare inlove aconsiderable
'amount ofnarcissistic libido overflows ontotheobject.
Itiseven obvious, inmany forms oflove choice, that
theobjectserves asasubstitute forsome unattained
egoideal ofourown.We love itonaccount ofthe
perfections which wehave striven toreach forour
ownego, andwhich weshould now liketoprocure
inthisroundabout wayasameans ofsatisfyingour
narcissism.
Ifthesexual over-estimation and thebeingin
love increase even further, then theinterpretationof
thepicture becomes stillmore unmistakable. The
tendencies whose trend istovv-ards directlysexual
satisfaction maynow bepushedback entirely,as
regularly happens,forinstance, with theyoungman's
sentimentalpassion;theegobecomes more andmore
unassumingandmodest, andtheobjectmore andmore
sublime andprecious,until atlast itgets possession
BeinginLoveandHypnosis
oftheentire self-love oftheego,whose self-sacrifice
thus follows asanaturalconsequence. Theobject
has, sotospeak, consumed theego.Traits of
humility,ofthe limitation ofnarcissism, and ofself-
injuryoccur inevery case ofbeinginlove;inthe
extreme case they are only intensified, and asa
result ofthewithdrawal ofthesensual claims they
remain insolitary supremacy.
This happens especially easilywith love that is
unhappy and cannot besatisfied;for inspiteof
ever}^thingeach sexual satisfaction ahvaysinvolves a
reduction insexual over-estimation. Contemporaneously
with this'devotion' oftheegototheobject,w^hich
isnolongertobedistinguished from asublimated
devotion toanabstract idea, thefunctions allotted to
theegoidealentirelycease tooperate. The criticism
exercised bythatfacultyissilent; everythingthatthe
object does and asks for isrightand blameless.
Conscience hasnoapplicationtoanythingthat isdone
forthesake oftheobject;intheblindness oflove
remorselessness iscarried tothepitchofcrime. The
whole situation canbecompletely summarised ina\i
formula: Theobject hastaken theplace oftheego /
ideal, J'
Itisnow easytodefine thedistinction between
identification andsuchextreme developmentsofbeing
inlove asmaybedescribed asfascination orinfatua-
tion. Intheformer case theegohasenriched itself
'j^Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
with thepropertiesoftheobject,ithas*
introjected'
theobjectintoitself, asFerencziexpressesit.Inthe
second case itisimpoverished,ithassurrendered itself
totheobject,ithassubstituted theobjectfor itsmost
importantconstituent. Closer consideration soonmakes
itplain, however, that thiskind ofaccount creates
an illusion ofcontradistinctions that have noreal
existence. Economicallythere isnoquestionofimpov-
erishment orenrichment;it isevenpossibleto
describe anextreme case ofbeinginlove asastate
inwhich theegohasintrojectedtheobjectinto itself.
Another distinction isperhapsbetter calculated to
meet theessence ofthe matter. Inthecase of
identification theobjecthasbeen lost orgiven up;
itisthen setupagaininside theego,andtheego
makes apartialalteration initself after themodel of
the lostobject.Intheother case theobjectis
retained, and there isahyper-cathexisofitbythe
egoand attheego's expense. Buthereagaina
difficulty presentsitself. Isitquitecertain that iden-
tification presupposesthatobject-cathexishasbeen
given up?Can there benoidentification with the
objectretained? And before weembark uponadis-
cussion ofthis delicatequestion,theperception may
already bebeginningtodawn onusthatyetanother
alternative embraces the realessence ofthematter,
namely, whether theobjectisputintheplace ofthe
egooroftheegoideal.

Butontheother handwemayalso saythat

Itisinterestingtoseethat itispreciselythose

easily beunderstood from thefact thattheyarenot
capableofcomplete satisfaction, while sexual tenden-

extraordinaryreduction throughthe dischargeof

thefate ofsensual love tobecome extinguished when

itmust itself undergoatransformation ofthiskind.

rests.
While LeBon isprincipally concerned withtypical

associations, Trotter haschosen asthecentre ofhis
interest themostgeneralised form ofassemblagein
which man, that C^cbov jtoXitikov, passeshislife,andhe
givesusitspsychologicalbasis. ButTrotter isunder
nonecessityoftracing back theherd instinct, forhe
characterizes itasprimary andnotfurther reducible.

ButTrotter'sexposition,withevenmorejustice

too little account ofthe leader'spartinagroup,
while we incline rather totheopposite judgement,
that itisimpossibletograspthenature ofagroupif

room at allfortheleader; he ismerely thrown in
alongwith theherd, almost bychance;itfollows,
too, thatnopathleads from this instinct tothe

But-besides this Trotter'sexpositioncanbeunder-

Itisnaturally noeasymatter totrace theonto-

ADIFFERENTIATING GRADE INTHEEGO
Ifwesurveythe life ofan individual man of
to-day, bearinginmind themutually complementary
accoimts ofgroup psychology givenbytheauthorities,
wemaylose thecourage,infaceofthecomplications
that arerevealed, toattemptacomprehensiveex-
position.Each individual isacomponent partof
numerous groups,heisbound bytiesofidentification
inmany directions, andhehas builtuphisegoideal
uponthemost various models. Each individual therefore/
hasashare innumerous groupminds—those ofhisrace,/
ofhisclass, ofhiscreed, ofhisnationality,etc.—and
hecan also raise himself above them totheextent
ofhavingascrapofindependence andoriginality.
Such stable andlasting group formations, with their
uniform andconstant effects, are lessstrikingtoan
observer than therapidly formed andtransientgroups
from which LeBon hasmade his brilliant psycho-
logicalcharacter sketch ofthegroupmind.And itis
justinthese noisy ephemeral groups,which areasit
102Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
were superimposed upontheothers, thatwearemet
bytheprodigyofthecomplete,, eventhough only
temporary, disappearanceofexactly whatwehave
recognizedasindividualacquirements.Wehaveinterpretedthisprodigyasmeaning
that theindividualgives uphisegoideal and substi-
tutes for itthegroupideal asembodied inthe
leader. Andwemust addbywayofcorrection
that theprodigyisnotequally greatineverycase.
/Inmanyindividuals theseparation between theego
(andtheegoideal isnotveryfaradvanced;thetwo
stillcoincidereadily;theegohasoften preservedits
earlierself-complacency. The selection oftheleader
isverymuch facilitated bythis circumstance. He
needonly possessthetypical qualitiesoftheindivid-

There isalwaysafeelingoftriumph when

And thesense ofguilt (aswell asthesense ot

Itiswellknown thatthere arepeoplethegeneral

excessive depression through some kind ofintermediate |

Letuskeeptowhat isclear :Onthebasis ofour^

ofmania theegoand theegoideal have fused
together,sothat theperson,inamood oftriumph
andself-satisfaction, disturbed bynoself-criticism, can
enjoythe abolition ofhisinhibitions,hisfeelingsof
consideration forothers, and hisself-reproaches.It
isnotsoobvious, butnevertheless very probable,that

aconflict inwhich the ideal,inanexcess ofsen-|

Theonly questioniswhether wearetolook forthe
causes ofthese altered relations between theegoand
theegoideal intheperiodic rebellions, which we
havepostulated above, againstthenewinstitution, or
whether wearetomake other circumstances respon-
sible forthem.
Achangeintomania isnotanindispensable

Itisotherwise intheCatholic Church. Every
Christian loves Christ ashisideal and feels himself
united with allother Christians bythe tieofidentific-
ation. But theChurchrequires more ofhim.He
has also toidentifyhimself with Christ and love all
other Christians asChrist loved them. Atbothpoints,
therefore, theChurchrequiresthat thepositionof
thelibido which isgiven byagroupformation should
besupplemented.Identification has tobeadded
whereobject-choicehastakenplace, andobjectlove
where there is-identification. This additionevidently
goesbeyondtheconstitution ofthegroup. One can

For thispurpose wemust return foramoment
tothe scientific mythofthe father oftheprimal

ofthegroupofvictors could take hisplace, or,
ifone ofthemdid, the battles began afresh,until
they understood that they must allrenounce their
father'sheritage. Theythen formed the totemistic
communityofbrothers,allwithequal rightsand
united bythetotemprohibitionswhich were to
preserve and toexpiatethememoryofthemurder.
Butthe dissatisfaction withwhat hadbeen achieved
stillremained, and itbecame thesource ofnew
developments. Thepersons whowere united inthis

ofthe old state ofthingsatanew level. Man
became oncemore thechief ofafamily, andbroke
down theprerogativesofthegynaecocracywhich had
become establishedduringthefatherlessperiod. As
acompensationfor thishemayatthat timehave
acknowledgedthemother deities, whosepriests were
castrated forthemother'sprotection,after theexample
thathadbeengiven bythe father oftheprimal
horde. And yetthenew family wasonlyashadow
oftheoldone; there were numbers offathers and
each onewas limited bytherightsoftheothers.
Itwas then, perhaps,thatsome individual, in
theexigencyofhislonging, mayhave beenmoved
tofree himself from thegroupandtake over the
father'spart. Hewho did thiswas the firstepic
poet; andtheadvance wasachieved inhisimagination.
This poet disguisedthetruth with lies inaccordance
with hislonging. Heinvented theheroic myth. The
herowasamanwhobyhimself had slain thefather—the father who stillappearedinthemythasa
totemistic monster.Justasthefather hadbeen the
boy'sfirstideal, sointheherowhoaspirestothe
father'splacethepoetnow created the firstego
ideal. The transition tothehero was probably
afforded bytheyoungest son, themother's favourite,
whom shehadprotected frompaternal jealousy,and
who,intheeraoftheprimal horde, hadbeen the
father's successor. Inthelying poeticfancies of
114Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
prehistorictimes thewoman, whohadbeen theprize
ofbattle andtheallurement tomurder, wasprobably-
turned intotheseducer andinstigatortothecrime.
Thehero claims tohave acted alone inaccom-
plishingthedeed, whichcertainly onlythehorde asa
whole would have venturedupon. But, asRank has
observed, fairytales havepreservedclear traces of
the facts which were disavowed. Forweoften find
inthem that theherowho hastocarry outsome
difficult task(usuallyayoungest son,and not in-
frequentlyonewho hasrepresentedhimself tothe
fathersurrogateasbeing stupid,that istosay,
harmless)—weoften find, then,that thishero can
carryout histask onlybythehelpofacrowd of
small animals, such asbees orants. These would
bethebrothers intheprimal horde, justasinthe
same wayindream symbolisminsects orvermin
signifybrothers and sisters (contemptuously,considered
asbabies). Moreover every one ofthe tasks in
myths andfairytales iseasily recognisableasa
substitute fortheheroic deed.
The myth, then,isthestep bywhich the
individual emergesfrom group psychology. The first
myth wascertainlythepsychological,thehero m)^h;
theexplanatorynature myth must have followed much
later. The poetwhohadtaken this stepandhad
inthiswaysethimself freefrom thegroupinhis
imagination,isnevertheless able (asRank hasfurther
Postscript 115
observed) tofind hiswayback to itinreality. For
hegoes and relates tothegrouphishero's deeds
which hehasinvented. Atbottom thishero isno
onebuthimself. Thus helowers himself tothelevel
ofreality, and raises hishearers tothe level of
imagination. But hishearers understand thepoet,
and, invirtue oftheirhavingthesame relation of
longingtowards theprimal father, they canidentify
themselves with thehero.^
The lieoftheheroic myth culminates inthe
deification ofthe hero.Perhapsthe deified hero
may have been earlier than theFather God and
may have been aprecursortothereturn ofthe
primalfather asadeity. The series ofgods, then,
would runchronologically: Mother Goddess—Hero—
Father God. But itisonly with theelevation ofthe
neverforgotten primalfather that thedeity acquires
thefeatures thatwe stillrecogniseinhimto-day.^

typicalcases isco-ordinated withtheOedipus complex,
succumbs, asweknow, from thebeginningoftheperiod
oflatency onwards toawave ofrepression. Such ot

analysis, which illuminates thedepthsofmentallife,
hasnodifficultyinshowingthat thesexual tiesof
the earliest yearsofchildhood alsopersist, though
repressed and unconscious. Itgivesuscourageto

Apsychologywhich willnotorcannotpenetrate
thedepthsofwhat isrepressed regardstender
emotional ties asbeing invariablytheexpressionof
tendencies which have nosexual aim,eventhough
theyarederived from tendencies which have such
anaim.^
We arejustifiedinsayingthat they have been
diverted from these sexual aims, eventhoughthere
issomedifficultyingivingarepresentationofsuch
adiversion ofaim which will conform tothe
requirementsofmetapsychology. Moreover, those
instincts which are inhibited intheir aims always
preserve some fewoftheiroriginalsexual aims; even
anaffectionate devotee, even afriend oranadmirer,
desires thephysical proximity and thesightofthe
person who isnowlovedonlyinthe^Pauline' sense.
Ifwechoose, wemay recogniseinthis diversion of
aim abeginningofthesublimation ofthesexual
instincts, orontheother handwemayfixthe limits

sexual instincts which areinhibited intheir aimshave

create permanent ties; while those instincts which are
directlysexual incur alossofenergy each timethey
aresatisfied, andmust wait toberenewed bya
fresh accumulation ofsexuallibido, sothatmean-
while theobject may have beenchanged. The
inhibited instincts arecapableofany degreeof
admixture with theuninhibited; they canbetrans-
formed back into them, justasthey arose outof
them. Itiswellknown howeasilyerotic wishes
develop out ofemotional relations ofafriendly
character, based upon appreciation and admiration,
(compare Moliere's 'Embrassez-moi pourI'amour du
grec'), between amaster and apupil, between a
performer andadelighted listener, andespeciallyin
thecase ofwomen. Infactthegrowthofemotional
ties ofthis kind, with theirpurposeless beginnings,

We shall naturally notbesurprisedtohear that
thesexual tendencies that areinhibited intheir aims
arise outofthedirectlysexual oneswhen inner or
outer obstacles make thesexual aims unattainable.
The repression duringtheperiodoflatencyisan
inner obstacle ofthiskind—orrather onewhich has
become inner.Wehaveassumed that the father of
theprimal horde owingtohissexual intolerance
compelledallhissons tobeabstinent, and thus
forced them into ties thatwere inhibited intheir
aims, while hereserved forhimself freedom ofsexual
enjoyment and inthiswayremained without ties. All
the tiesupon which agroup dependsareofthe
character ofinstincts that areinhibited intheir aims.
Butherewehave approachedthediscussion ofa
newsubject, which deals with the relation between
directlysexual instincts andtheformation ofgroups.

judgedtobeofequal value, somewhat inthesense
ofBernard Shaw's malicious aphorismtothe effect
thatbeinginlovemeansgreatly exaggeratingthe
difference between onewoman andanother.
There areabundant indications thatbeingin
loveonlymade itsappearancelateoninthesexual
relations between men andwomen: sothat the
122Group Psychology andtheAnalysis oftheEgo
opposition between sexual loveandgroupties isalso
alatedevelopment. Now itmayseem asthough
thisassumptionwere incompatible with ourmythof
theprimal family. For itwas after allbytheir love
for their mothers and sisters that the troopof
brothers was, aswehavesupposed,driven to
parricide; and itisdifficult toimaginethislove as
being anythingbutunbroken andprimitive—thatis,
asanintimate union ofthetender and the sensual.
But further consideration resolves thisobjectioninto
aconfirmation. One ofthereactions totheparricide
was after allthe institution oftotemistic exogamy,
theprohibitionofanysexual relation with those
women ofthefamily whohadbeen tenderly loved
since childhood. Inthiswayawedge was driven in
between aman's tender andsensualfeelings,one still
firmly fixed inhiserotic lifeto-day.^ Asaresult ot
thisexogamythesensual needs ofmenhad tobe
satisfied withstrangeandunloved women.
Inthegreatartificialgroups,thechurch andthe
army,there isnoroom forwoman asasexual
object. The love relation between men andwomen
remains outside theseorganisations. Even where
groupsareformed which arecomposedofbothmen
andwomen the distinction between thesexes plays
nopart. There isscarcely anysense inaskingwhether

thelibido which keeps groups togetherisofahomo-
sexual orofaheterosexual nature,for itisnot

shows acomplete disregardfortheaims ofthegenital
organisationofthe libido.
Even inaperson whohasinotherrespects become

become toostrong they disintegrate every group
formation. The Catholic Church had thebest of
motives forrecommendingitsfollowers toremain
unmarried and forimposing celibacy uponitspriests;
butfallinginlove hasoften driven evenprieststo
leave thechurch. Inthesamewaylove forwomen
breaksthroughthegroupties ofrace, ofnational
separation, and ofthe social class system, and it
thusproduces importanteffects asafactor incivili-
zation. Itseems certain that homosexual love is
farmore compatiblewith group ties, evenwhen it
takes theshapeofuninhibited sexual tendencies—a
remarkable fact, theexplanationofwhich might carry
usfar.
Thepsycho-analytic investigationofthepsycho-
neuroses hastaughtusthat theirsymptomsareto
betraced back todirectly sexual tendencies which

thisformula byaddingtoit:or,totendencies inhibited

that aneurosis should make itsvictim asocial and
should remove himfrom theusualgroupformations.

E.Inconclusion, we willadd acomparative
estimate, from thestandpointofthe libido theory,
ofthestates withwhichwehavebeen concerned, of
beinginlove, ofhypnosis,ofgroup formation, and
oftheneurosis.
Beinginlove isbased uponthesimultaneous
presenceofdirectlysexual tendencies and ofsexual
tendencies that are inhibited intheir aims, sothat
theobjectdraws apartofthe narcissisticego-libido
to itself. Itisacondition inwhich there isonly
room fortheegoandtheobject.
Hypnosisresembles beinginlove inbeinglimited
tothese twopersons,but itisbasedentirely upon
sexual tendencies that are inhibited intheir aims
and substitutes theobjectfortheegoideal.
Thegroup multipliesthisprocess;itagreeswith

other individuals, which wasperhaps originally made
possible bytheir havingthesame relation tothe
